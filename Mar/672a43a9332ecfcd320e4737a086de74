The Mile 12 Perishable Traders Association on Friday appealed to the Lagos State Government to reopen the market to mitigate the financial losses that could accrue from produce wastage. Mr Femi Odusanya, spokesman for the association, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that reopening of the market would guarantee continuous food supply to the state. NAN recalls that Gov. Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State on March 3 ordered a temporary closure of the market following violence within the communities in the area. The governor said the decision to shut the market and restrict movement on the streets were to aid security agencies to restore the peace in the area. Odusanya said: “We plead with the government to review its order on the closure of the market to reduce the quantum of produce to be wasted”. “We have over 20 trucks each filled with sixty baskets of tomatoes worth N5,000 per basket rotting in the trucks in the market because of the delay in offloading them. “This is aside the over eighty trucks of tomatoes and pepper meant for the market parked at Ibafo, Ogun State. “To waste these produce would amounts to huge financial losses for traders who are struggling to survive under the harsh economic climate of the country.” Odusanya said that prolonged closure of the market would have negative multiplier effects on the prices and availability of foods in the state. “Mile 12 Market plays a vital role in providing food to various markets and households in the state. “With the abrupt closure of the market, high cost of food items arising from food scarcity will be experienced in the state within days.” Odusanya said that the traders were victims of the fracas that ensued between commercial motorcyclists and the residents of Mile 12 community. “The market has nothing to do with the brawl but it is so unfortunate that by virtue of our location we are affected by the situation that has paralysed economic activities.” (Source: BUSY GHANA)
