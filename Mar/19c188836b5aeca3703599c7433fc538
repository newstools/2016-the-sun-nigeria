PRESIDENT of the Nigeria Football Federation, Mr. Amaju Melvin Pinnick has hailed the spirit of the Federation’s corporate partners and sponsors, who have remained steadfast in spite of the prevailing economic downturn. Pinnick made this commendation on Sunday, while receiving his award as Sports Personality of the Year at the Excellence Recognition Awards 2016, held at the Balmoral Hall, Oregun, Lagos. “I dedicate these award to all our sponsors, who have remained committed to Nigeria football despite the odds and the challenges of the economic situation. We are very proud of them. “We appreciate them much more than they think. In thick and in thin, they have been there for the National Teams and other programs of the NFF. On our part, we will continue to ensure that each and everyone of our partners get good mileage for the relationship in all activities and events of the Federation.” The NFF President added commendation for Otunba Michael Adenuga Jnr, chairman of Globacom, for keeping faith with Nigeria football over the past 15 years. “Otunba Adenuga and Globacom have been very special, very supportive of Nigeria football since the turn of the Millenium. That deserves special applause. “We are committed to working assiduously to even improve on the mileage that our various partners and sponsors have been getting before now, through a few activations we are set to put in place.” NFF’s current partners and sponsors include Globacom, Guinness Nigeria PLC, NIKE, ZENITH Bank, Emzor Pharmaceuticals, Industrial and General Insurance, Supersport, Pamodzi and Sports Radio Brila.
