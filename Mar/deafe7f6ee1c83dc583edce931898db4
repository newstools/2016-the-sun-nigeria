Enyimba is through to the second round of the CAF champions league despite losing away in Bujumbura by 2-1 to Vitalo today.
The Peoples Elephants had last week won the first leg at home by 5-1 at the Adokie Amiesimaka Stadium, Port Harcourt thus advancing 6-3 on aggregate.
Nigeriaâ€™s other representative in the competition, Warri Wolves bowed out of the competition after losing 0-1 away to top Sudanese side El Merriekh. Wolves had last week lost the first leg at home in Warri by the same margin.
In the CAF Confederation Cup, it was another sad story for the country as Nasarawa United crashed out to Algerian side Constantine FC. Nasarawa who had won the first leg at the Abuja National Stadium by a lone goal was walloped 4-1 in Constantine by her Algeria host.
It is recalled that Akwa United had earlier crashed out of the competition in the very first round. The Promise Keepers failed to keep their promise against Congolese side VC Mokanda a fortnight ago. Akwa lost right in front of her fans at the Uyo Nest of Champions. The club won 1-0 away only to bow by the same margin at home and subsequently bowed out 5-6 on penalties.
