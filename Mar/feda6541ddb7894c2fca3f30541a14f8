Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode on Monday expressed shock and sadness over the demise of foremost nationalist and prominent lawyer, Dr. Tunji Braithwaite. Braithwaite died in a Lagos hospital on Monday at the age of 82. In a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Habib Aruna, Governor Ambode said Braithwaite’s demise was a great loss to both the state and the nation. Describing the late nationalist as a detribalized individual whose example is worthy of emulation, Governor Ambode said Braithwaite was a man of the people, a typical Nigerian who was consistent in saying things the way they are, not caring whose ox is gored. The Governor recalled that during the military era, especially that of the late General Sani Abacha administration, when politicians were afraid to come out and contest, Braithwaite dared the odds and came out to contest against the late General at the risk of his life. “He was very consistent in fighting for what he believed was right and fair to every human regardless of their ethnic leaning or creed, he was not one to shy away from taking a position that he strongly believed in.
