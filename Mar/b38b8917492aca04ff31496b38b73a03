The Campaign for Constitutionalism and Human Rights (CCHR), a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), on Friday called on the Federal Government to disregard calls for economic conference. Instead, the organisation urged the government to implement the report of the National Conference held in 2014. Executive Secretary of the group, Mr Toyin Raheem, said in a statement in Lagos that an economic conference would only amount to waste of time and resources. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, had on Feb. 18, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to convene an emergency economic conference to enable experts brainstorm on the way forward and future of the economy. “We call on President Muhammadu Buhari to disregard the call for another economic conference but to rather act on the report of the economic committee of the last national conference. “This will be a ‘do-tank’ towards revamping the economy. “We also expect Soyinka to join the masses to convince the President to act on the report. “The conference had not just economic committee, members of the committee were among best brains in the country. “Their recommendations were ratified by all members of the national conference before it became a part of their report,” he said. Raheem commended Soyinka for his patriotism and for preferring solution to the economic mess which the country was currently contending with. He attributed the economic down turn of the country to maladministration and lack of planning of successive governments. He said that the call for economic conference was not only unnecessary, but uncalled for and could only be another think tank and a duplication of efforts and waste of resources. The secretary said the national conference had members from all tribes and geo-political zones of the country, adding that all categories of Nigerians and groups were also represented Source: NAN
