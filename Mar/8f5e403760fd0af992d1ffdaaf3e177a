A 62-year-old man, Adewale Mabun, has been arrested and charged before Isolo Magistrates’ court for allegedly selling his late father’s house for N500,000 without involving other siblings in Lagos State, western Nigeria. He was remanded in prison custody after he failed to meet his bail condition. Ogun State-born Mabun allegedly contacted Rasheed Komolafe and negotiated to sell their late father’s bungalow for the amount which he paid. The house in question is located at 11, Silva Street, Mushin where the family buried their late father. The late father married three wives and many children while Mabun is the eldest. It was gathered that during the negotiation, it was agreed that Mabun will evacuate their late father’s corpse to enable Komalafe to take possession and paid another amount for the evacuation. While the transaction was going on, other children from their late father did not know about it. Trouble started after Mabun secretly evacuated their father’s corpse from the tomb and carried it to their home town and buried it. He remained there with the new wife he married. When members of the family realized what Mabun had done, the resisted it and asked Komolafe to collect his money back from Mabun. Consequently, Komolafe went to the police and reported what happened and the police trailed Mabun to his home town and arrested him. He was brought him back to Lagos to face prosecution. When the police asked him to refund the money, he said he had spent it by building a shop in their village and marrying another wife. He was charged to court with obtaining under false pretence and
stealing under the Criminal code. When Mabun was arraigned, he pleaded not guilty. The presiding Magistrate, Mrs A. K. Shonubi granted Mabun bail in the sum of N200,000 with one surtey in like sum. He was remanded in prison custody at Kirikiri pending when he will perfect his bail condition. The matter was adjourned till 11 April, 2016. Source: PM News
