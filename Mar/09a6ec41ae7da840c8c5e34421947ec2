A new act, Jbaba (Okonkwo Onyebuchi Joseph) is about to take the Nigerian music scene by storm as he drops his sophomore single entitled Falling for You produced by DJ Coublon.
In a chat with Entertainer, the Imo State born singer said he was excited and looking forward to giving his best to his growing fan base: “I’m excited. After so many months working in the studio with my producer, my latest single entitled Falling for You, which was produced by DJ Coublon hits the airwaves today. I am calling on all my fans out there to go online and download it. Also listen to radio stations very closely, as Falling for You is the new hit song in town.”
Born in 1993, Jbaba has been singing since he was 14 years-old. The graduate of Electronics & Electrical Engineering from Madonna University recorded his first single at age 15 when he recorded That Lady, his first song ever.
Commenting on how he gets inspiration for his songs, Jbaba continues: “My inspiration comes from my environment. And I am at my best when I am in the studio hanging out with my producer and feeling the beat.”
“I want to make a name for myself in the industry and Tuface is my role model. My style of music is Afro-highlife which is the new sound in Nigeria.”
Jbaba is currently under the management of Evergreen Entertainment. He dropped his debut single entitled Linda, last year September.
Commenting on what inspired his Falling for You, the new kid on the block said: “It’s the story of a girl I am falling for and telling her that I will do anything to make her mine.”
