From ROSE EJEMBI, Makurdi. The Benue State Police Command has said that peace had been restored in communities of Logo Local Government area of the state which were engulfed in Fulani crisis in the last few days. Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Moses Yamu who stated this in a chat with Daily Sun yesterday confirmed that only one person was killed while some houses, mostly thatched settlements were burnt down in the crisis. Yamu also stated that as a result of the killing of the farmer and burning of houses in the community, members of neighbouring communities fled their homes for fear of being attacked by the rampaging Fulani herders. “There was crisis between the Tiv farmers and Fulani herdsmen in Gaambe-Tiev area of Logo in which one person was killed and some houses, mostly thatched houses were torched. This crisis resulted in members of neighbouring settlements in the area to begin to flee their homes.” While disclosing that both the Military and Mobile Policemen had been deployed to the area to keep peace, the Police spokesman urged members of the Gaambe-Tiev community who fled their homes in during the crisis to return to their homes. “However, peace has been restored to the area as both soldiers and Mobile policemen had been drafted the to maintain peace, law and order.
