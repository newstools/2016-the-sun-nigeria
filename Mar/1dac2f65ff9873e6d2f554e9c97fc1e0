The Enugu State Police Command says nine suspected cultists including students, artisans and traders disturbing the peace of the state have been arrested. While briefing newsmen in Enugu on Tuesday, the command’s spokesman, Mr Ebere Amaraizu said the suspects had been terrorizing some parts of Enugu State for over two months now. Amaraizu said, “Through our intelligence, we arrested some of them at their meeting place. “Three of them were arrested after exchanging fire with policemen and this group was responsible for the killing of the son of a police inspector in Emene community and the same group also killed a hotel
manager in the same community.’ “The Command will continue school sensitisation campaign against cultism to redeem and dissuade our children not to take after these social misfits and the command would continue to demonstrate zero
tolerance for cultism in its entire ramification,” the spokesman added. “We will continue to hunt them down,” he noted as he reinstated the warning to cultists to relocate from the state.
