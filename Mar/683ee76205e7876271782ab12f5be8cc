A school head of a public primary school in Akwa Ibom State has been sent to jail for the abuse of a 12 year old pupil in his School. The wife of State Governor, Mrs Martha Emmanuel disclosed this during a seminar for young girls drawn from secondary schools across the state. She didn’t reveal the identity of the school head, the school nor the victim. She also made known that some parents have been prosecuted in the state for allegedly forcing their daughters into relationships with men for material gains. Mrs Emmanuel who was represented by the Commissioner of Women Affairs in the State, Dr. Glory Edet, said the seminar for the young girls held in Uyo weekend was part of activities to mark the international women day celebrations in the state. She said the state government remained resolute on the protection of the rights of the child and counselled young girls to report any case of abuse of their person and womanhood to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. “Now we also have family courts because the state government is interested in the future of the girl child and that is the more reason we have also prioritized education to help the young ones build a good future”, she said.
