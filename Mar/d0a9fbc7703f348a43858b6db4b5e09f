BY GEORGE ALUO, WITH AGENCY REPORTS SUPER Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa has sent signals of what fans should expect from him when Nigeria, Egypt do battle later this month in the back to back AFCON 2017 qualifiers.
Musa who is on the radar of top Eng­lish Premier League sides scored the winner last night as his club CSKA Moscow beat Spartak Moscow 1-0 in a Russian Premier League game decided at the Arena Khimki.
Goal.com reports that the Nigerian converted from close range in the 11th minute after teammate Zoran Tošić’s ef­fort was cleared off the goal line of the visitors.
CSKA Moscow had enjoyed few chances before the break, but Ro­man Eremenko should have scored five minutes into the second half, as Spartak Moscow keeper Artem Re­brov denied the striker at the back post.
The Horses now boast of 40 points from 19 games.
Musa is among Samson Siasia’s 42 man invitees for the games against Egypt.
The player had last week sent words home to Siasia assuring him of his preparedness to lead the on­slaught against the Pharaohs on the pitch.
Musa it would be noted was hand­ed the Eagles skipper’s band by Sun­day Oliseh who has since thrown in the towel as manager of the team.
Meanwhile, Ahmed Musa says he prefers to play for Arsenal than to pen a deal with English Premier League leaders, Leicester City.
The Nigerian international has been the subject of transfer rumours away from Russian side CSKA Mos­cow, with both Leicester City and Arsenal linked to the player.
23 year-old forward Musa, who has scored 11 goals for CSKA this season, has played a prominent role for both club and country.
