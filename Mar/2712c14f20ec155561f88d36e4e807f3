• It’s a lie –Govt From Tony Osauzo, Benin‎ Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State, Chief Dan Orbih has accused Governor Adams Oshiomhole of plotting to round-trip $75 million World Bank loan to raise N10 billion to fund the state governorship campaign for his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). Orbih alleged Oshiomhole intends to sell dollars from the World Bank loan at the black market to raise the amount to finance the election. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has slated the election for September 10. “In the past few months, a particular bank has donated its private jet to the Edo governor to bring in the $75 million World Bank loan. They want to sell it at the black market rate and it will bring in N10 billion. “The action is criminal. The $75 million is to be collected at the normal rate and sold at the black market…” Orbih said. But Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Kassim Afegbua slammed Orbih and dismissed his allegations as unfounded. “Orbih should have known that the World Bank is not like Ogbona Community Bank where you can abuse financial procedures. He has just shown the reckless financial orientation of the PDP and their brigandage and voodoo economics…” Otherwise, he would not even contemplate that a world bank would carry money in sacks and hand over to a state government,” Afegbua said.
