AFTER his superlative performance with Arsenal at the weekend, Super Eagles invitee, Alex Iwobi is expected in the country today ahead of the crucial AFCON qual­ifier against the Pharaohs of Egypt.
The 19-year-old Iwobi voted man of the match on Saturday when he crowned his first Premier League start with a goal for Arsenal to stay in hot chase for a 14th championship said he was looking forward to the match against Egypt.
“I am looking forward to playing in the AFCON qualifying match against Egypt. It’s going to be a very tough match as the Egyptians have a lot of quality players including my team mate Mohamed Elneny,” Iwobi told AfricanFootball.com
“But I am confident that we have the experience in our team to get the result we need.
“I do not regret my decision to play for Nigeria. I feel honoured by the call-up to play in the qualifier against Egypt and hope that I will make a contribution in the AFCON qualifiers and other future tournaments.
“I urge the fans to come out in great numbers to sup­port the team.”
Iwobi is not a stranger to coach Samson Siasia hav­ing trained with his Olympic team last year.
“I have in the past worked with coach Samson Sia­sia, he is a very good coach and encourages his players to express themselves on the pitch,” he remarked.
Iwobi told AfricanFootball.com he was equally fo­cused on Arsenal toppling surprise team Leicester at the top of the Premier League table.
The Gunners are 11 points adrift of Leicester with eight rounds of matches left to be played.
