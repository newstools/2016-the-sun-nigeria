The pipelines, which are lo­cated along the creeks of Odidi Community in Warri South-West Local Government Area of Del­ta State, could not however be torched by the rampaging gun­men due to prompt response by soldiers.
Daily Sun gathered that the incident happened in the early hours of yesterday.
It was gathered that during the encounter with the militants, two of the soldiers attached to the Joint Task Force, were wounded while repelling the suspected militants.
A top security source, who disclosed the incident to our cor­respondent, could not however, confirm the number of casualties on the side of the militants who later fled due to the superior fire power of security agents.
A senior military officer, who confirmed the development to Daily Sun, disclosed that the at­tack was successfully repelled by the gallant soldiers.
The spokesperson of the Joint Task Force (JTF), Operation Pulo Shield, Col. Isa Ado, later con­firmed the incident.
Col. Ado explained that al­though details of the incident were still hazy, his men success­fully repelled the attempt which was meant to blow up oil installa­tions along the creeks.
