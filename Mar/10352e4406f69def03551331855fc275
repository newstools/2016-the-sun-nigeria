ON TWITTER #Brussels: World Shocked at ISIS Terror in the Heart of Europe The world woke up to news on Tuesday of bomb explosions at the Brussels International airport and a city metro station in the Belgian capital. About 34 people have been reported dead and several more injured in the most recent of a spate of radical islamic terror/suicide attacks that have rocked Europe in recent months – the more recent being the Paris attacks late last year which left several hundred dead – and the arrest of one of its masterminds (in Brussels) days before this most recent event. The city was placed on security lockdown after the attacks with hashtags #Brussels and #PrayForBelgium trending on Twitter as events developed. Donald J.
