FROM JULIANA TAIWO-OBALONYE, ABUJA PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has distanced himself from a pressure group, #Istandwithbuhari and has warned the group to desist from using his name and that of his wife to promote it’s activities.
The Senior Special Assistant on Media and Public­ity, Garba Shehu in a statement said the Presidency de­mands the advocacy group should immediately stop claiming any alliance with the Buhari Administration.
It described as inconsistent with the Buhari’s hu­mility the group’s celebration of his administration achievement, adding that it was premature.
The Presidency said “Among other reasons, we have found it necessary to distance the Presidency from the #Istandwithbuhari group because its pre­mature and ostentatious. Celebration of the present administration’s achievements is totally inconsistent with President Buhari’s philosophy of service with humility.
“While the present administration has indeed re­corded significant successes in its priority areas of improving security across the nation, ending the Boko Haram insurgency, curbing official corruption and re­vamping Nigeria’s economy, President Buhari is well aware that his government still has a lot of national challenges to overcome.
“The President prefers to give his fullest attention to addressing those challenges without the unsolicited and unwelcome distraction of untimely praise-singing from groups with dubious and questionable motives”.
