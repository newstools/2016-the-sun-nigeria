…As IPMAN, NSCDC lock horns over bribery allegation By Wole Balogun, Ado Ekiti FOLLOWING the alleged arrest of tanker drivers oper­ating in Ekiti State by men of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NCSDC), the agency and Independent and Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) seem to have drawn a battle line in Ado-Ekiti, the state capi­tal, leading to the latter pre­venting tankers from taking fuel into the state in protest against what they called un­lawful arrest and extortion of their members by men of the NSCDC.
The independent market­ers have since written a pe­tition to the state Governor, Ayo Fayose, from the cham­bers of E. K. Adetifa, legal practitioners.
The petition, dated March 22, 2016 and addressed to the governor on behalf of IP­MAN, described the excesses of the NSCDC as having adverse effects on their busi­nesses.
It accused NSCDC of un­lawful arrest and detention of tanker drivers bringing pe­troleum products to the state under the guise that the prod­ucts were being diverted from other states.
“Our client has further in­formed us that on March 21, the National Chairman of Pe­troleum Tankers Drivers’ As­sociation (PTDA) has directed members not to bring petro­leum products to Ekiti until the spate of reckless seizure, arrest and detention by NSCDC is firmly abated.”
The Chairman of IP­MAN in Ekiti, Mr. Ayodele Owoeye, while addressing journalists yesterday on the issue, said the indication of the foregoing directive was that it would unleash adverse economic impact on the state.
Owoeye, who was repre­sented by Alhaji Suleiman Akinbami, pleaded with gov­ernment to wade into the mat­ter to prevent total closure of petroleum business in Ekiti.
But the state Comman­dant of NSCDC, Ekiti Com­mand, Mr. Ibrahim Raji, who described the allegations as frivolous, said the market­ers should be bold enough to mention whoever takes bribe from them, rather than resort­ing to blanket condemnation of his officers.
