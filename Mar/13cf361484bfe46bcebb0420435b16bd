The Governor of Ekiti State, Mr. Ayodele Fayose declared on Friday that his administration would not hesitate to shut down the Federal University, Oye Ekiti if it fails to remit the statutory taxes to the stateâ€™s
coffers. He warned the authority of the university to either remit taxes due to the state or risk the university being closed down. For the umpteenth time, Fayose also lambasted President Muhammadu for sacking some Vice Chancellors recently, describing the action as illegal and unconstitutional. The governor, who made the declaration when the newly appointed Vice Chancellor of FUOYE, Prof. Kayode Soremekun paid him a courtesy visit in his office, said contradict commonsense should be avoided. Fayose maintained that payment of taxes is germane and important and it should be respected by the school without which it would face the consequences. (Source: THISDAY)
