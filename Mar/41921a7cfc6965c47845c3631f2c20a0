BY GEORGE ALUO, JUST BACK FROM ALEXANDRIA VICTOR Moses has confessed that he is still in pain over the Super Eagles failure to qualify for the 2017 Nations Cup. Moses whose 82 minute grounder hit the wood works and failed to go in as the Eagles bowed by 1-0 to the Pharaohs said he couldn’t believe Nigeria won’t be in Gabon. “ I returned to the team with high hopes. I had confidence that we will get the result we need against Egypt to go through. We fought well but luck was not on our side,” Moses told Daily Sunsports exclusively. He said football being what it is, results like the one Nigeria got in Alexandria sometimes do come a team’s way. “We have no option now but to put it behind us and prepare well for the World Cup qualifiers. But the truth is that I m still in pain as to how we drew the Kaduna game and losing in Alexandria. If our late rally in Alexandria had paid off, we would still have been in the race. Samson Siasia assembled a good team that didn’t deserve the result we got,” he said.
