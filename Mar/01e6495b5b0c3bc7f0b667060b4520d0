The Managing Director of Soltan Travel and Tours Limited, Mrs. Victoria Soluade has hailed Tour Brokers International (TBI) for its efforts in deepening Cruise holiday sales in Nigeria. Soluade, the pioneer and leading wholesale cruise agent for Nigeria and Ghana, as well as the official Representative for Cruises International in Nigeria, also extolled TBI for choosing to brand their office as a Royal Caribbean Cruise sales outlet. “TBI was one of the first agencies to run with our vision of promoting cruise vacations in Nigeria while their representative participated in our very first agents’ FAM Cruise in September 2006. We are proud of how far they have come and are glad they have found their niche in the market. “Soltan Travel product offers include over 18 Ocean and River cruise companies. There is such a wide variety to suit every sector of the market. I, therefore, seize this opportunity to encourage other agents who are yet to sell cruise holidays to join us. For those who prefer to specialize in a particular cruise product or destination, you are welcome so to do”, she said in a statement.
