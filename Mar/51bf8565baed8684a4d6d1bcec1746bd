BY WOLE BALOGUN, ADO EKITI THE Federal High Court sitting in Ado Ekiti, Capi­tal of Ekiti State, yesterday ordered the Department of the State Security Services, (DSS) to immediate­ly release Hon Afolabi Akanni, allegedly whisked away by the security agency during the alleged in­vasion of the State Assembly on March 4.
Alternatively, the court, in its ruling, delivered by Justice Taiwo Taiwo, ordered the DSS to produce Akanni in court on Wednesday, March 16 and show cause why he would not be released.
Akanni, lawmaker representing Efon Constitu­ency, was picked up during the alleged invasion for yet-to-be disclosed reason. He had since remained in detention and several calls by the State House for his release had fallen on deaf ears of the DSS.
Consequently, Akanni, through his lawyers, Oba­femi Adewale and
Bunmi Olugbade, sought the court’s intervention through an ex-parte application, seeking the protec­tion of his fundamental human rights in line with Section 35 (1) of the 1999 constitution.
In an ex-parte motion number FHC/AD/ CS/18/16, dated March 10 and supported by 21-paragraph affidavits, deposed to by a member of the state House of Assembly, Hon Tunji Akiyele, sought an order of the court compelling the DSS to release him pending the determination of the sub­stantive issue.
