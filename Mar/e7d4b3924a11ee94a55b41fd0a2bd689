BY JOE APU Lagos State based amateur football club side, Oceania G United said that their dream of making it to top flight league will not be hampered by their round of 32 ouster in the ongoing Lagos State Federation Cup championship. Club Proprietor, Sunny Imanah told Daily Sunsports after his team bowed out of this year’s competition that he had a belief that the team was going through teething problems but will overcome it with time as the team progresses. “We’re a young team that aim to be among the best but like everything new, there are stumbling blocks along the line and they are expected. That we’re not moving to the next round in this year’s championship does not mean that we won’t continue playing. It is our desire to continue with the players and make steady progress until we achieve our dream of playing in the topflight league in Nigeria.” Coach of the team, Mohammed Emokparie while assessing his team said he was impressed with the players but noted that they need experience. “Given our performance last year in the federation Cup when we lost out in the round of 32, our players moved a step further losing out this time around in the round of 16. We had a good game against Messiah FC but we lost to inexperience. We won’t stop at this but continue to forge ahead and go for the LAFA League and work toward gaining promotion into the national league.” He said that having played against teams like Moonluck FC and Glorious Academy coached by Godfrey Esu and Taiwo Enegwa respectively, the coach looks forward to better days for his side.
