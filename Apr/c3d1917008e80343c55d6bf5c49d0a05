From PAUL OSUYI, Asaba Leadership crisis has rocked the Delta State chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Secondary Schools (ASUSS) following the removal of the chairman, Comrade Uti Geoff Chuks and the subsequent appointment of Comrade Imasua Stephen as the new chairman. Comrade Chuks who became the second chairman of the fledging union in 2010 was accused of running the union like a personal estate, hence the decision of the State Central Working Committee (SCWC) to relief him of the appointment. Sunday Sun gathered that the union has extended its operations to 16 out of the 25 council areas of the state. Addressing newsmen in Asaba, the new chairman of the union, Comrade Imasua who was flanked by the secretary, Comrade Ohwofaria Austin, and representatives from ten council area chapters said the ousted chairman was taking sensitive decisions without consulting other members of SCWC. “The chairman for the past six months failed to call for a meeting despite the persuasion of the first and second vice chairmen. This is a sign that he is spent and lacks the idea, and the driving force that the union need at this trying period,” he said. Imasua alleged that the the embattled former chairman unilaterally took a decision of “co-joining in a law suit instituted against the Trade Union Congress (TUC),” without the consent of members of the highest decision making organs of the union both at the state and at the national level. But Comrade Uti Chuks in a reaction dismissed his purported removal, saying that the secretary and those aligning with him were under suspension for alleged clandestine moves to use the Association of Senior Civil Servants to distabilise the union. He added that a vote of no confidence was passed on Comrade Imasua as chairman of the Ika South council chapter, noting that the said Imasua has been expelled for parading himself as the chairman of ASUSS in the state.
