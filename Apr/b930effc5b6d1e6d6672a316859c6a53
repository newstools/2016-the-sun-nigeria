Senate President Bukola Saraki arrived the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) without the usual array of senators in tow.
It was observed that he was not accompanied by any senator as he arrived  the tribunal at 10:15am.
But two senators later joined him after 45 minutes.
This is the first time the senate president arrived “solo” at the tribunal.
In October 2015, at least 81 senators accompanied Saraki to the CCT. But the number kept plummeting afterwards.
On Wednesday, only two senators accompanied him to the tribunal.
Meanwhile, Danladi Umar, chairman of the CCT, will rule on Saraki’s application asking him to withdraw from the trial.
Saraki is facing multiple counts of false declaration of assets.
