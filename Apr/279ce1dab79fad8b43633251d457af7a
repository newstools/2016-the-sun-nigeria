From Okey Sampson, Aba FOLLOWING the down turn in the price of oil in the global market, the Governor of Abia State, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu has vowed to diversify the economy of the state to reduce the effect of the lull in oil price. This, Ikpeazu said would ensure that development was not stalled so that Abia would become a ‘one stop shop’ where investors can establish businesses within 48 hours of entering the state. Speaking in Umuahia during his maiden quarterly press briefing for 2016, the governor described Abia as the Small and Medium Scale Enterprise (SMEs), capital of Nigeria, and as such everything should be to ensure the state maintains that position. The governor noted that the strategic location of the state had placed it in a situation where it was minutes away from the capital cities of Port Harcourt, Owerri, Uyo among others, and vowed to take advantage of the opportunity to develop leather work, garment and shoes which Aba was noted for. He said it was to ensure unhindered access in the state that his administration has completed 27 roads and two bridges out of the 65 it embarked on across the state since he was inaugurated on May 29, 2015. Ikpeazu noted that the roads which were built with cement pavement technology to enable them last longer, were fitted with well-designed drainages and streetlights. However, he identified rainfall as a major factor threatening the completion of the projects, but promised to focus on other sectors. On education, the governor hinted that his administration had concluded plans to build two model primary schools, which will be equipped with modern facilities to enhance learning in each of the three senatorial zones.
