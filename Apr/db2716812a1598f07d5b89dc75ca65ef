A university don has argued that the cost of importing petroleum products for 30 days is capable of building up to 15 modular refineries in the country, Vanguard reports. A Director, Centre of Gas, Refining and Petrochemicals, Institute of Petroleum Resources, University of Port Harcourt, Prof. Godwin Igwe, who said this at the African Modular Refinery Seminar in Lagos, also said modular refineries will diversify the Nigerian economy, with its security implications for the country as well as increase internally generated revenue and reduce fuel scarcity. As regards illegal refineries, Igwe said: “We can train and turn the ‘illegal refineries’ to ‘legal refineries. The ‘illegals’ already have the necessary raw production skills. We just need to provide guidance and training. The knowledge gap in distillation processes will be provided on appropriate standards, specifications, and catalysis.”  (Source: ENERGY MIX)
