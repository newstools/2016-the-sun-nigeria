 A Federal High Court Â sitting in Abuja on Tuesday rejected an application by the immediate past National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki (retd), seeking an order discharging him of charges preferred against him and another order prohibiting the Federal Government from further prosecuting him. The presiding judge in the case, Justice Ademola Adebiyi, ruled that the former NSA did not follow proper process in filing a contempt charge against the federal government; hence it is out of place for him (Dasuki) to ask that the charges brought against him be dropped for reasons not weighty. Colonel Dasuki, had on March 3, also asked a Federal High Court in Abuja to stop his trial. He also asked the court to set aside the criminal charges of unlawful possession of fire arms brought against him by the Federal Government. Dasuki told the court that the Federal Government no longer has moral and legal rights to continue his trial having disobeyed the order of bail granted him since Nov 3, 2015. The Court refused his application as the trail judge, Justice Peter Affem, held that contrary to the application by Colonel Dasuki, it was the Department of State Services (DSS), which was not a party in the suit that arrested Colonel Dasuki and not the EFCC. He agreed with the anti-graft agency that it had not flouted any part of the orders releasing the former National Security Adviser (NSA) on bail. Meanwhile, an Abuja High Court on April 6, fixed May 3 for the trial of former National Security Adviser, Colonel Sambo Dasuki, facing charges of diverting funds meant for the purchase of arms for soldiers fighting insurgency in northeast Nigeria. Justice Hussein Baba-Yusuf fixed the date and directed that the prosecution allow full access to lawyers to Colonel Dasuki during business hours of Monday to Friday to enable them take instructions and prepare defence for their client.
