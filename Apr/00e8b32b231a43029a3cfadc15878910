 From Okey Sampson, Aba MOVEMENT for the Actu­alisation of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) has given the Federal Govern­ment a 30-day ultimatum to end the incessant attacks by Fulani herdsmen on in­nocent people in states in the South East or face its wrath. The warning came on the heels of Monday’s attack by Fulani herdsmen on a community in Uzo Uwani Local Government Area of Enugu State in which about 15 people were allegedly killed. MASSOB, which said it was worried by the inabil­ity of the Federal Govern­ment to stop the increasing destruction of farmlands, raping of women, armed robbery, kidnapping as well as killing of innocent Nige­rians by Fulani herdsmen. National Director of In­formation of MASSOB, Sunny Okereafor, who handed down the ultima­tum in an interview with newsmen in Aba, said the Federal Government has been playing with fire over the attacks and threatened that MASSOB will not fold its arms and allow Fulani herdsmen invade Igbo com­munities to rape women, kill residents and burn their houses. According to him, “MASSOB is worried that Fulani herdsmen have be­come very daring in their attacks since President Bu­hari came to power. “We are not saying Bu­hari is their sponsor, but his silence over the attacks is suspicious. MASSOB is giving Buhari a 30-day ul­timatum to stop the attacks or face our wrath. “Again, we are warning Fulani herdsmen and their sponsors to withdraw from Biafra land. They should count Igbo land out of their Islamisation policy. “We are also warning Ndigbo to remain on alert, as these Fulani herdsmen are terrorists posing as herdsmen. Soon, they will pay for all their atrocities against the people of Bi­afra.” Okereafor, who disclosed that his group had set up a committee to monitor the activities of Fulani herds­men in Igbo land, added that MASSOB would be forced to abandon her non-violent policy to protect Biafrans if the Federal Government re­fuses to check the invasion of its communities by the herdsmen.
