ABIA Warriors Foot­ball Club of Umuahia Manager, Kennedy Boboye has assured their teeming supporters that the 0-1 loss the team suf­fered in Warri Wolves, which ended the club’s 10-match unbeaten run in the Nigeria Profes­sional Football League (NPFL) will not derail the club’s ambition of winning the league or at least picking a continen­tal ticket at the end of the season. Boboye, who spoke to newsmen shortly after the game ended at the Warri City Stadium, noted that he would have loved the unbeaten run to continue adding that the defeat was disappointing to him and the entire team. He however assured their fans that they have put the defeat behind them and will now work towards ensuring that they bounce back in subsequent matches. “We put up a gal­lant fight here (Warri) but narrowly lost. This is not the end of the road for us. We will go back home, correct our mistakes and bounce back to winning ways”, Boboye stated. The former Sunshine Stars of Akure tactician commended his boys for their efforts during the game despite the odds against them insisting that victory could have gone either way. During the match, king Osanga scored the only goal in the 53rd minute and despite pin­ning their hosts to their own half for almost the entre second half, Abia Warriors could not find the equalizer.
