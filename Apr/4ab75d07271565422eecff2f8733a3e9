The Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) has called on Nigerians to support the commission by reporting corrupt practices to it.
Mr Stephen Pimor, the ICPC Commissioner for Oyo/Ogun zone, made the call in an interview with newsmen in Ibadan on Thursday.
Pimor said that the commission was ready to protect whistle blowers, assuring that the commission will investigate credible and anonymous petitions.
“We urge our people to furnish the commission with useful information on corrupt practices around them.
“Let me also inform them that we investigate credible and anonymous petitions in the case of those who have useful information but doesn’t want their identity disclosed,” he said.
Pimor said that the commission had received petitions that were under investigation but did not disclose the number of such petitions.
“We have received some petitions and they are under investigation. I am very sure some of the petitions would be recommended for trial.”
He said that it was premature to disclose the class of cases under investigation.
Pimor assured the media of getting adequate information as soon as investigated case were recommended and presented for trial.
The ICPC boss solicited maximum support from the media and security agencies in fighting corruption to a standstill as preached by President Muhammadu Buhari.
Pimor said that he had visited the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) camp in Iseyin to enlighten and engage the youth corps members on the need to stamp out corruption from country.
He said that the commission was also prepared to enlighten youth clubs and other associations on the fight against corruption, to strengthen the anti-corruption campaign from the grassroots. (NAN)
