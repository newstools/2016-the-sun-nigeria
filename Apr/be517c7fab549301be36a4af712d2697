The Rivers State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Bro Felix Obuah, says he was ready and would appreciate the Minister of Transport and former state governor, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, to undertake a facility tour of the numerous road projects   completed and commissioned by Governor Nyesom Wike. The State PDP Chairman, who stated this while taking inventory of the achievements of Governor Wike’s one year after being voted into office in April 2015, said these impressive achievements have demonstrated that the present administration in the state is fully committed to making life better for the people. He said he would be glad if the former governor of the state could embark on a facility tour of the state to see for himself what good governance is all about. The reconstructed roads he said include the Abonnema/Obonnema Link road/bridge, Eagle Island/Iloabuchi road/bridge, Abuluoma – Woji Link road/bridge, the Oyigbo Market Road, the Nkpogu – NLNG road/bridge, the reconstruction of Igwuruta – Chokocho Road etc. Obuah said that over 120 kilometres of these roads have so far been constructed and rehabilitated across the state since May 29, 2015 when Wike took oath of office as the executive governor the state. “The facility visit and, or tour has become necessary not only to show the immediate past government and its functionaries led by Rotimi Amaechi as governor and Dakuku Peterside as his works commissioner how to prudently use scarce resources for maximum output, but also to prove that the popularity and goodwill being enjoyed by the Wike administration is not based on fallacy but concrete achievements,” he said. The PDP state chairman believes that given the rancour free environment by cynics, distracters and self-seeking politicians, the Wike administration will no doubt raise the bar of democratic dividends beyond measure for Rivers people. “We are also inviting all stakeholders at home and in the Diaspora for on-the-spot assessment of these roads already completed and commissioned by Governor Wike in the State besides other breakthroughs in the health, housing, judiciary, education, empowerment/poverty alleviation, transport and sports sectors etc, and they will be amazed at what the governor has been able to do with the little resources at his disposal and will regret and agree that the eight years of Amaechi administration in the State despite the huge resources he controlled was a colossal waste”,  he declared.
