Meanwhile, the manage­ment of Union Bank Plc last week explained that giving its negative retain earnings in the last four years, it cannot pay dividend for the financial year ended December 31, 2015. Its Chief Financial Offi­cer, Oyinkan Adewale, who disclosed this during the bank’s Fact Behind the Fig­ure presentation at the Nige­rian Stock Exchange (NSE) in Lagos, said the bank had to abide by the regulatory directive which stipulates non-payment of dividend by company with negative retain earnings until its finan­cial status changes. “As long as we have nega­tive retain earnings and as long as the regulatory laws of Nigeria prevent you from paying dividend when you have negative retain earning, until we are able to resolve that with the regulators, there is absolutely nothing Union Bank can do about paying of dividend”, he said.
