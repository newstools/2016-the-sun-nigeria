THE Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has lambasted the South- East and South-South senators and members of House of Represen­tatives for allowing the National Grazing Re­serves Commission Bill to pass the second read­ing. The group said the in­ability of the lawmak­ers from the two zones to stop the bill showed that they have been used by their colleagues from the North, adding that they are only after their personal interests and not the interest of people they are representing. A statement by the Media and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, Mr. Emma Powerful said the group discovered that they have been alleged­ly bought over by their Hausa/Fulani counter­parts in the Senate and House of Representa­tives. “IPOB are warning them that this is a sys­tematic way of bring­ing the invaders into our land and they are coming to Islamize us (we children of Chukwu Okike Abiama) God Al­mighty. “Again, we are warn­ing the South-East and South-South governors to tread with caution because we don’t have places to use as Fulani ranch and any governor who allocates a place will bear the conse­quences and posterity will never forgive those who sabotage his or her people. “More so, the high­est producers of cows grazing and ranch in the world is Argentina fol­lowed by Australia, they have not been ravaging and destroying farmland or causing problems with the people, let the northern governors allo­cate enough land in their state to them because we have no land for cow rearing in Biafraland,” the group said. Meanwhile, IPOB has alleged that prison authorities have joined Department of State Services (DSS) to manhandle Nnamdi Kanu in the Kuje Prison. “His life is uncomfortable in the prison, the prison authorities have mandated that anybody who visits him (Nnamdi) will go through severe searching when going in and coming out. “IPOB calls on the public to note that if anything happen to Kanu, we will hold the prison comptroller responsible,” it said.
