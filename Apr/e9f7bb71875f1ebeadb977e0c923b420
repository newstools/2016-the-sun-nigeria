Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers has said that his administration will promote commercial agriculture to create employment opportunities for youths.
Wike said this while receiving the Port Harcourt Branch Controller of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Kazeem Adekunle-Alaka, in Port-Harcourt on Tuesday.
The governor added that the government focused on oil palm and cassava production as the areas of investment.
He said that massive investment in agriculture would further develop the state’s economy and enhance food security.
Wike used the occasion to commend the CBN for its firmness and consistency in the application of the nation’s monetary policies.
“The current attitude of the CBN toward monetary policy issues has put to rest the policy somersaults’ witnessed in the past.
“I commend the CBN governor and the bank’s management for being firm in the application of economic policies, this to me is a good omen for the country,’’ he said.
Wike identified the Bank Verification Number (BVN) policy as one that had resulted in huge positive gains to all facets of the economy.
“The BVN policy has led to tremendous reduction in the wage bill of our state; today only verified staffs are paid salaries.
“With the good policy initiatives springing up from the CBN, I want to assure you that we will always collaborate with you in our programmes,’’ he said.
Earlier, Adekunle-Alaka said that the apex bank would collaborate with the state government in order to ensure the development of agriculture. (NAN)
