(Godwin Tsa, ABUJA) Some reprieve may have come the way of Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki as the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice Ibrahim Auta has granted his request by directing Justice Abdul Kafarati to deliver judgment in his (Saraki’s) case against the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT). In the suit, Saraki, who is standing trial for alleged false assets declaration sued the CCT chairman, Danladi Umar and others involved in his trial. It was, however, gathered that judgment in the suit has been rescheduled to Friday, March 15. Justice Kafarati had, on March 22, declined to deliver judgment on the matter following online publications suggesting that he was compromised. Consequently, he informed parties that he was withdrawing from the case and returning the case file to Justice Auta for reassignment to another judge. Saraki is, in the suit filed for him by his lawyer, Ajibola Oluyede, contending that his trial before the CCT, as currently constituted was a violation of his right and that there was no way he could get justice. It is also Saraki’s contention that, while the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) was currently investigating Umar for alleged bribery and, at the same time, prosecuting him (Saraki) before the tribunal he (Umar) heads, it was impossible for the CCT chairman to do justice and act independently in his (Saraki’s) case. Kafarati hinged his decision on publications by some on-line media, which he (the judge) said had cast him in bad light and portrayed him as a compromised judge.
