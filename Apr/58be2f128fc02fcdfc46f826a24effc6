.As Gunners shatter title dream CHELSEA’S caretaker boss, Guus Hiddink, yester­day lost his first EPL game since taking over the club in December as the Blues fell 1-0 away to Swansea. While Chelsea bowed to Swansea, Arsenal’s title hopes ended effectively with the 3-3 draw it played out yesterday against West Ham. Arsenal surprisingly threw away a 2-0 lead in the game in which West Ham’s Andy Caroll scored a hat trick. It would be noted that Hiddink who replaced Jose Mourinho on an interim basis in December has suc­cessfully guided Chelsea into the top half following a disastrous start to their title defence. However, in the first match since Antonio Conte was confirmed as Mourinho’s permanent suc­cessor, it was the Welsh club who celebrated reaching the fabled 40-point mark at the Liberty Stadium. Arsenal boss, Arsene Wenger had after yesterday’s game literally thrown in the towel as far as the EPL title race is concerned. “Third in the league, that’s not where we want to be. We’ve made it much more difficult for ourselves to win the championship…,” were Wenger’s words.
