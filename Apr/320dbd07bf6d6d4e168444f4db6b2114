A hard fought victory! That was what Enyimba secured last night in the Tunisian city of Sousse as she edged out Etoile to romp into the group stage of the money spinning CAF Champions League. Enyimba went into last night’s game clutching a 3-0 first leg lead which the Tunisians cancelled out. Both teams then went into the lottery of penal­ties which the Peoples Elephants won. Enyimba keeper, Theophilous Af­elokhai was the hero of the night. He saved the last kick of Etoile when the penalty shoot out went into sud­den death. Both sided had thrown away two each of the five initial penalties only for Afelokhai to pull the save that saw Enyimba through.
