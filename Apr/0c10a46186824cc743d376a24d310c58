He alleged that the Hisbah Guards confiscated an unspecified number of cartoons of beer, a laptop belonging to the hotel’s director, four handsets and a car belonging to a guest. Witnesses alleged that the operation by the state religious body sparked off tension in the neighborhood as members of the community kept vigil all through the night out of fear of the unknown.
