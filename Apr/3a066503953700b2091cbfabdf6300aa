From Magnus Eze, Abuja and Bimbola Oyesola THE Central Working Committee (CWC) of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) may have yes­terday, considered declaring a one-day national warning strike to protest the refusal of the Federal Government to reduce electricity tariff. NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, who addressed the media before the CWC meeting of the Con­gress in Abuja said it would form part of their de­liberations. Wabba insisted that the 45 per cent tariff in­crease was “illegal, unfair, unjustifiable and an exploitation of the already exploited Nigerians. “The CWC will agree on a day to embark on the strike because several actions promised by the Federal Government to checkmate the tariff in­crement have not been implemented.’’ He decried the response of government at all levels to the prevailing economic situation in the country and said it has become a further source of worry for many Nigerians, especially the work­ers, “who are the first, historically, to be put up for sacrifice each time the political elite misman­age our economy.’’ Wabba said the current fuel scarcity in the country has further worsened the condition of workers and Nigerians in general. “We have been patient with this government but this persistent scarcity and suffering of our people will no longer be tolerated.’’ He commended the National Assembly for thoroughly vetting the Appropriation Bill before passing it but, urged President Muhammadu Bu­hari to take urgent steps to implement it. “The passage of the budget is expected to open or free up the economy. “Our observations will not be complete without commenting on the decision of Mr President to withhold his assent until the details on the budget are transmitted to him by the National Assem­bly,” Wabba said.
