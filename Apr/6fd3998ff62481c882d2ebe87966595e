LUIS Enrique has urged Barcelona to remain “open-minded” about Atlético Madrid and has challenged them to embark on another winning run following Saturday’s Clásico defeat. “We have played Atlético a few times in the last couple of years but we need to analyse them and be open-minded because they may play differently this time. They are a top team with a clear philosophy; they are dangerous on the counter and pressure you up high. “Atlético have amazing individual quality with [Antoine] Griezmann and [Fernando] Torres. They have many ways of causing us trouble and can hurt us on set pieces and transitions,” Enrique said. Atletico coach Diego Simeone on his part says ‘There’s not much room for surprise’. “Both teams know each other very well. So I don’t think there is much room for surprise. They play a specific type of football and they play spectacularly well under Luis Enrique. “I don’t think Barcelona’s defeat by Real Madrid will affect our game. We always expect the best of Barcelona. They will definitely be up for it, playing at home. They are strong, tough opponents. We are used to seeing MSN [Messi, Suárez, Neymar], with all the individual qualities that make Barcelona even better. Hopefully they will face the best of us as well.”
