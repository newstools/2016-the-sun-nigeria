By Judith Nwabia Super Eagles goalkeepers trainer, Alloy Agu is confident Nasarawa United will on Sunday return to Lafia with the nation’s most glamorous soccer diadem, the Federation Cup when they do battle with millionaire side FC IfeanyiUbah at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos.
Agu who is also the goalkeepers trainer for the Solid Miners said yesterday that the club has perfected strategies on how to make Ubah’s investment in the competition go down the drains. The former Super Eagles first choice keeper told SuperSports.com his side’s greatest joy will be to lift the Federation Cup trophy.
In his words: “Our greatest joy will be to lift the Federation Cup trophy at the expense of the opposition, FC IfeanyiUbah. We have come a long way…Sunday’s clash will be the Cup final and not the final before the final so we strongly believe that God will give us victory.
“FC IfeanyiUbah is a strong side and for them to have finished fourth in the hotly contested Nigerian top-flight showed the club is a solid side. We equally have a good team and we are not leaving anything to chance but working assiduously on the mental and physical fitness of the players to ensure they deliver on match day. The players know the stake in the final is a ticket to the continent and nobody will want to toy with that.”
The winner of the Cup final will have the opportunity of representing the country in Africa’s second tier club competition, Caf Confederation Cup.
Nasarawa featured in the same competition this year but crashed out in the second round to a Senegalese side.
