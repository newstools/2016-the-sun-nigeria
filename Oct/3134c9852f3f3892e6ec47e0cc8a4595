Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, says President Muhammadu Buhari respects women, citing the appointment of Kemi Adeosun, finance minister, as a demonstration of that. ‎Reacting to the media frenzy ignited by Buhari’s statement that his wife Aisha belonged in the kitchen, Shehu said that Buhari was only joking. “My friends, can’t a leader get a sense humour any more? Mr President laughed before that statement was made,” he said.‎ ‎”He was obviously throwing a banter. “Politics sometimes should be spiced with humour. Those of us close to him know there is never a dull moment with him. “Mr President respects the place of women in our society. He believes in the abilities of women. “One of Nigeria’s most sensitive office today is headed by a woman, Mrs Adeosun. This is an evidence of the confidence he reposes on women.‎” In an interview she granted the BBC, Aisha had alleged that the government had been hijacked. She also said that she might not support her husband under the present circumstances if he seeks re-election in 2019. Buhari was reacting to the statement when he said: “Aisha belongs to my kitchen, living room, and the other room.”
