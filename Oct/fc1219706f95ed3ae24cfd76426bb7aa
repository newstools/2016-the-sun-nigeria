Super Eagles left back, Elderson Echiejile says starting the 2018 World Cup campaign in Zambia takes the pressure off his team.
Echiejile, one of 23 players that Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr has called up for this weekend’s World Cup Group B qualifier against Zambia, said the fixture favoured the Super Eagles.
“The fixture is a really good start for us. At least starting away is good because it takes off the pressure, so we will just go out there and get a good result. If we start very well with the away game, that will be really good for us,” Echiejile told local media.
He admitted that the match against Chipolopolo would not be easy.
“To be sincere it is not going to be easy.  But with hard work, and commitment, and playing well as a team, it is going to be a positive result at the end,” said Echiejile.
