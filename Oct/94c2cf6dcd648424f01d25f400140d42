From PAUL OSUYI, Asaba MORE facts emerged late yesterday on how Mrs Margaret Emefiele, wife of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele was abducted by gunmen on Thursday afternoon.
Mrs. Emefiele was waylaid by the gunmen around Ugoneki town along the Benin-Asaba-Onitsha expressway in Edo State. The operation left one of her orderly dead, according to a source.
The source said Mrs. Emefiele had boarded a flight from the nationâ€™s capital of Abuja and landed at the Benin Airport in Edo State from where she left for Agbor by road.
It was further gathered that the hoodlums intercepted the Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) that the high profile citizen was in and shot one of her orderly who attempted to resist the operation.
It was not yet clear how many persons the heavily armed men took away into the bush but sources said at least two persons including Mrs. Emefiele were whisked away.
However, Delta State Police Command yesterday said it was not aware of any kidnap of any high profile citizen including Mrs. Emefiele.
Speaking on phone with our correspondent in Asaba, Public Relations Officer of the command, SP Celestina Kalu said the command was yet to get any information on the incident, saying if it was true, it did not happen in Delta State.
Meanwhile, some residents in Agbor said that the news was still strange to them as they were not aware of the abduction that took place on Thursday.
