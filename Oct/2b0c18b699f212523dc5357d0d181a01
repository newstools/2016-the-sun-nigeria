• As Leicester secures first away point BY IKENNA OKAFOR Tottenham’s revenge mission against Leicester City ended in disappointment yesterday as Super Eagles winger, Ahmed Musa earned the Premier League champions a 1-1 draw at White Hart Lane.
Leicester beat Spurs to the title last season and the club frustrated Mauricio Pochettino’s men again in yesterday’s game. Musa’s second-half equaliser cancelled out Vincent Janssen’s first Premier League goal from the penalty spot.
The draw gives Leicester her first point away from home in the league this season while Tottenham has now gone five matches without a victory.
Also, Alex Iwobi continued his rapid rise within the Arsenal squad as he started his eighth game for the Gunners in the 4-1 victory over Sunderland.
The winger has already featured in more than half of the total games he played the entire 2015 and is fast becoming one of the first names on Arsene Wenger’s starting line-up.
The Nigerian international broke into the team last season and although he was quite impressive against Sunderland, he was replaced by Olivier Giroud. Iwobi will no doubt be happy that his team came away from the game with all three points.
Giroud, coming off the bench scored a brace to add to Alexi Sanchez’s two goals to ensure that Arsenal returned to London with maximum points.
Odion Ighalo was on the pitch for the entire duration of Watford’s 1-0 win over Hull City while Kelechi Iheanacho watched from the bench as Manchester City ripped West Bromwich Albion apart to end its six-match winless run with a 4-0 win at the Hawthorns.
Aguero went eight games without scoring for club and country, but he found his shooting boots again after netting two, while Gundogan also scored twice in a relatively comfortable Premier League clash for Pep Guardiola’s men.
