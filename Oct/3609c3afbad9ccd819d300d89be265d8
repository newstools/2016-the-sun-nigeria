 …Kill inspector, loot armoury From Wole Balogun, Ado-Ekiti PANDEMONIUM broke out in Ido-Ekiti, Ido-Osi Local Government Area of Ekiti State on Friday night as gunmen numbering about 40 allegedly invaded the Divisional Police Station in the community and killed a police inspector on duty.
Sunday Sun gathered that the armoury of the police station was emptied by the gunmen, who also blew off the roof of the station’s building.
A detective attached to the station, who craved anonymity, described the invaders as suspected armed robbers, noting that the attack took place at 7.20pm on Friday. He said the gunmen destroyed virtually all property in the police station when they were searching for ammunition.
Sunday Sun observed that police officers attached to the station all looked demoralised when newsmen called at the station yesterday.
The detective further said the suspects broke through the gate with their vehicle, while some of them also scaled the fence and headed to the armoury first.
He said the heavily armed bandits rained bullets on a police inspector who died on the spot.
“They drove in recklessly and took over the entire police station. Some even scaled the fence and took strategic positions. They shot into the air sporadically and destroyed virtually every room.
“Our suspicion was that they came to loot the armoury because that was where they first attacked after demobilising our men. In fact, they emptied the entire place,” he said.
The police officer said that nobody was detained in the cell as at the time the incident took place.
Efforts to reach the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Alberto Adeyemi were unsuccessful, as all his mobile phones were switched off. But a police officer confirmed that the PPRO had visited the station to get first hand information about the incident.
