The Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) has indicted former minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Elder Godsday Orubebe on false asset declaration.
CCT chairman, Danladi Umar, delivered the judgment convicting Orubebe of the offence.
He, however, gave Orubebe a a light sentence.
“I hereby seize, on behalf of the federal government, the property known as plot 2057.
“The prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and all evidence tendered were admitted,” said the CCT chairman.
He held that Orubebe committed an offence for not declaring a piece of property in Abuja, which Orubebe claimed he had sold.
The Federal Government had filed a one-count charge of false declaration of asset against Orubebe and insisted he committed the offence while he was a public officer.
The former minister is better known for his outburst at the national collation centre of the 2015 presidential election, in an attempt to prevent Attahiru Jega, a professor of political science and chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), from declaring the results of the election.
Speaking with newsmen after the proceedings, Larry Izimoje, Orubebe’s lawyer described the judgment as a travesty of justice.
“This is beyond travesty of justice. I can say that this is a case of whether you like it or not, I must convict you,” he said.
“That’s what played out today. Thank goodness, this is not where it ends. The court of appeal is there, so, we will definitely appeal.”
