President Muhammadu Buhari has responded to a remark by his wife, Aisha, that his government has been hijacked by a cabal. Buhari spoke in the German capital, Berlin, when he answered reporters’ questions. “I don’t know which party my wife belongs to, but she belongs to my kitchen and my living room and the other room,” the Associated Press quoted the president as saying. “So I claim superior knowledge over her and the rest of the opposition because in the end I have succeeded. “It’s not easy to satisfy the whole Nigerian opposition parties or to participate in the government.” Mrs. Buhari had said she might not back her husband’s re-election in 2019 unless he shakes up his cabinet. In an interview with the BBC, Mrs. Buhari said the president “does not know” most of the top officials he appointed to office.
