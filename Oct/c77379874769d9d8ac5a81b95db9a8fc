Gernot Rohr has gone tough – he will no longer call up players he describes as “vacation players” because they have failed to fight for first-team places after two invitations.
“Some players have been invited for two matches but have yet to push for a place in the first team and now we wish to invite fresh players to do what they could not do,” Rohr said.
“The time is gone when a player comes for two matches, collects bonuses, allowances and ticket refund and does not measure up.
“What we need now are players who can fight for first-team shirts and so make the team more competitive.”
The likes of Israel-based midfielder Nosa Igiebor, Kingsley Madu from Zulte-Waregem of Belgium, Rangers goalkeeper Emmanuel Daniel and Jamiu Alimi from Kano Pillars could fall into this bracket of “vacation players”.
