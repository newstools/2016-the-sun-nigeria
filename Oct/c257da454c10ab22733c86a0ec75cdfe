Super Eagles Technical Adviser, Gernot Rohr, on Wednesday paid a surprise visit to the Falconets’ evening training session at the FIFA Goal Project Pitch in Abuja, where he handed out success tips to the team.
Rohr, accompanied by the NFF Head of Women Football, Ruth David, expressed optimism in the ability of Falconets to soar at the forthcoming 2016 FIFA U20 Women’s World Cup in Papua New Guinea.
X-raying the country’s Group B opponents Japan, Canada and Spain, the former defender said that Nigeria boasts of a rich pedigree of at the global level which their opponents will find hard to surpass. He harped on the need for hard -work and humility as the keys to success and advised the girls to imbibe the spirit of team -work and respect for their opponents.
“Nigeria is a strong contender for the trophy. This is a team that fought till the end in the last tournament and I believe they can make history again. I want the team to understand the importance of team -work because it is the bed -rock for the success of any team. I want the girls to be humble at all times and respect their opponents.
“Be focused and business –like even while you are winning. Until the final whistle is blown, do not allow the euphoria of victory becloud your sense of purpose.
“This is the same advice I gave to the Super Eagles against Zambia. We focus on the game while it is on and after the game has ended, we can celebrate and greet our supporters.”
Nigeria will open her World Cup campaign against Japan on November 13, 2016 at the Bava Park in Port Moresby.
