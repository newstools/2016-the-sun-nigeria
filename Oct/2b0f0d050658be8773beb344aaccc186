Nigerian actor, Babatunde Omidina, popularly known as Baba Suwe is sick. Omidina’s health is deteriorating, said producer and actor Yomi Fabiyi, who is soliciting for assistance on his behalf. On his Instagram page yesterday, Fabiyi said Omidina’s health deteriorated after his encounter with officials of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in 2011 when he was accused of cocaine trafficking. Baba Suwe was arrested by the NDLEA at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, but was later released after screening and was exonerated. He spent several days with the NDLEA. He later approached the courts for the restoration of his fundamental human rights and was granted general damages to the tune of N25 million against the NDLEA. NDLEA is yet to pay the money, Fabiyi said, and appealed to stakeholders in the entertainment industry to rally round Baba Suwe. “I am calling on all senior colleagues in the entertainment world, especially those close to Baba Suwe because I don’t have everyone’s contact. Please, reach out to him ASAP” “He told me he no longer feels comfortable since that episode with the NDLEA. Baba Suwe is a widower, he can hardly walk properly as I speak, let alone go on location.How will he feed and take care of the children Aunty Moladun left behind? “This is an A-Lister entertainer and this silence gives me Mental agony. I don’t want to speak when it may be too late; I won’t forgive myself.’’ Fabiyi said Baba Suwe told him that while he was being interrogated, a long pipe was inserted through his anus and was detained for too long because he was randomly suspected of being a cocaine trafficker. Aside the N25 million NDLEA was directed to pay to Baba Suwe by the court, the agency was also directed to tender an open apology to him. He said, “In my opinion, only lazy, ill-trained, unfit and uncivilised officers torture in the name of investigation.”
