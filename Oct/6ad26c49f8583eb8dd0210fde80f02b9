From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Berlin, Germany President Muhammadu Buhari on his way home at the end of a three-day official visit to Berlin, Germany, visited Brigadier-General Mohammed Sani Aliyu, the acting commander of the 3 Division of the Nigerian Army, Jos, who miraculously survived a ghastly road accident in the course of a duty tour in the North-East.
Aliyu has been receiving treatment in a Berlin hospital for the past six months. The accident, which occurred on the Maiduguri-Damaturu Road, had claimed the life of the Head of Training and Operations of the Nigerian Army, Major-General Yusha’u Abubakar, who was in the same vehicle with Aliyu
President Buhari, accompanied by the Governors of Borno and Imo; National Security Adviser (NSA), Brig. Gen. Babagana Monguno; Minister of Interior, Gen. Abdulrahman Dambazzau and that of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, congratulated Aliyu on the progress he had made in his treatment.
The Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, who accompanied Buhari on the visit, said in a statement that the President and his delegation wished him a quick recovery and an early return to his family and duties in Nigeria.
He gave a further assurance that his administration would continue to accord priority to the health and wellbeing of service personnel.
The doctors told Buhari that Aliyu could barely move his head only when he was wheeled in on a stretcher, with the rest of the body torn and broken in many parts. Now, he can move around with very little assistance.
He thanked the president for his visit, saying his spirit to serve Nigeria remains unbroken.
