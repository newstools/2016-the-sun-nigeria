The divorce of Pastor Chris and Pastor Anita Oyakhilome of Christ Embassy Church hit the headlines and was one of the most talked about stories of the year.
Pastor Chris and his wife lived apart for several yesrs; she, in London and he, in Nigeria.
Now, Pastor Anita’s latest name change is the latest news in town.
After the dissolution of their marriage, Pastor Anita began addressing herself as Anita Ebhodaghe.
On Sunday, August 31, two days after the news of Anita filing for divorce surfaced online, her pictures and personal information were reportedly deleted by Christ Embassy from its official website, www.christembassy.org.
Christ Embassy’s new website now shows only Pastor Chris, with a broad smile welcoming his followers.
In the past, when they were a couple, Pastors Chris and Anita held hands on the church website and smiled broadly as they projected the image of a perfect couple.
Yesterday, however, a new name has emerged and everyone is wondering if she has found love again and tied the knot for the second time.
In a post on her Facebook page, in “A Simple Prayer,” she signed off with: Anita Ebhodaghe Schafer.
Sources close to Pastor Anita said “they have no information on a wedding at this time…” while another source said the name is simply “a homage to her mother” as “she is of Nigerian and Swiss parentage” and her new name recognizes both her father and mother’s surnames.
