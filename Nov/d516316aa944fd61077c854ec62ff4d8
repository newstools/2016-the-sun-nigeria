Diego Costa scored his 10th goal of the season as Chelsea won 1-0 at Middlesbrough to record a sixth consecutive victory and take over at the Premier League summit.
Costa struck for the third straight game with halftime approaching in yesterday’s game as Antonio Conte’s side underlined their title credentials by posting a sixth clean sheet in a row.
It took them a point clear of Liverpool and Manchester City, and three ahead of fourth-place Arsenal.
“It was a good performance against a very strong team,” Chelsea manager Conte told Sky Sports.
“Don’t forget Middlesbrough drew with Arsenal and Man City away. For this reason I’m pleased for the performance and attitude of my players.
“If you have the possibility to kill the game, it’s important to kill the game. But I’m pleased because Middlesbrough showed themselves to be a good team.”
Only the woodwork prevented Chelsea from winning by a more handsome margin as Pedro Rodriguez hit the bar midway through the second half, during which Middlesbrough were forced to hang on for long spells.
Aitor Karanka’s side retained hope while the deficit remained at a single goal, but the gulf in class between the sides was clear.
It leaves Boro one point above the relegation zone in their first season back in the Premier League following promotion.
“I am really pleased with the attitude of my players,” said Karanka.
“I am not worried about the look of the league table at the moment because all I am concerned about is the performances.
“If the performances were bad I would worry, but if the performances are good then we will start to win games.”
