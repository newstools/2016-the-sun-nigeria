From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)  has called on well meaning Nigerians to prevail on the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, to reinstate the Ojuromi of Uromi, Anselm Edenojie, who was deposed by the administration of former governor of the state,  Adams Oshiomhole.
Edenojie, was deposed last week by the Edo State Government for allegedly assaulting a woman in Uromi, during the September 28 Edo governorship election.
The PDP in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Prince Dayo Adeyeye, yesterday said the monarch was deposed for ostensibly supporting the party’s candidate Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, in the governorship poll,
The party, while condemning the deposition, said it is an evidence of the bias of the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration in Edo State, as some traditional rulers in the state equally supported Obaseki, who was the APC candidate in the election.
According to the opposition party:”The deposition is further evidence of favouritism and despotic reign of Oshiomhole as governor of Edo State for the past eight years.
“It is also evidence of the desire of the APC to destroy constitutional and traditional institutions, as well as the constitutional rights and freedom of the Nigerian people in its bid to establish a one party state.
“The constitution of Nigeria empowers Nigerians to support, associate with and be affiliated to any political party and candidate of their choice.
“It is a well known fact that several traditional rulers demonstrated open support, and in fact campaigned for the APC candidate, Mr. Godwin Obaseki. This obvious bias and willingness to destroy constitutional and traditional institutions that do not display  support for the tyrannical and anti-people programmes and policies of APC is ripping the democratic gains of the past 16 years in shreds.”
