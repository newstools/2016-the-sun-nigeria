From Wole Balogun, Ado-Ekiti Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, yesterday, paid a surprise visit to his predecessor, Segun Oni, at his Ifaki Ekiti countryhome.
In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Idowu Adelusi, Fayose said it was mere courtesy visit and proper for him as a governor and leader.
The visit, which took place at about 2.30pm, had his Chief of Staff, Chief Dipo Anisulowo on the entourage.
The governor said he had useful discussion with Oni, claiming that a governor is the leader of all.
“Ekiti comes first and leadership is about sacrifice to make for the purpose of unity.
“That is exactly what I am doing. There is a difference between leadership and politics. To me, Ekiti comes first; every leader willing to make Ekiti first, I will visit him. I am the governor of the state and everybody is my subject. My visit to Segun Oni has nothing to do with politics. When it comes to how to move Ekiti forward, we must firstly remove our political garment,” Fayose said.
Receiving Fayose, Oni said he was overwhelmed with the visit, which he claimed was brotherly. “It is a brotherly visit, I am happy for that. It is welcome development and good for Ekiti State. We are both leaders of the state,” Oni said.
Shortly after he came to office, Fayose restored the portrait of Oni which was removed by former governor Kayode Fayemi from the Governor’s Office‎. Fayose also ‎restored all his benefits as former governor of the state.
