By Adetutu Folasade-Koyi Opening up on how he was toppled in a palace coup in August 1985, President Muhammadu Buhari said he was removed by some corrupt, senior military officers.” Buhari became Nigeria’s head of state, through a coup, on December 31, 1983. Former military president, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, a retired general and former military president, Aliyu Gusau, former director of military intelligence (DMI), and other members of the then ruling Supreme Military Council (SMC) took over power on August 27, 1985. After his overthrow, Buhari was put under house arrest for so many months until his release in 1988, after the death of his mother. In a chat with The Interview, Buhari said he was overthrown because of his crusade against corruption in the military. He said senior military leaders ousted him to save themselves from his wrath. The president revisited the issue on a two-day working visit to Edo State, yesterday. Buhari said many had forgotten that he spent most part of his 40 months detention in the ancient city. “Not many people may remember: I spent most of the 40 months of my detention, following the 1985 coup, in a small bungalow here in Benin,” he said. Yesterday, after inaugurating a remodeled 200-bed capacity ultra modern central hospital, which the administration of Governor Adams Oshiomhole, the outgoing governor, built in Benin, Buhari said he was impressed with the edifice. The president also noted that it was “the best way to do things and the best thing to do for the people” by any government. He also inaugurated the Upper Siluko Road in the state capital and said “the road will stand the test of time. “Oshiomhole could have built a new Government House but, he chose to construct roads for his people.” Buhari said he was in the state for the third time to inaugurate projects build by Oshiomhole’s administration.
