By Adetutu Folasade-Koyi Senate President, Bukola Saraki said, yesterday, he stands with his colleagues on the rejection of President Muhammad Buhari’s request to borrow $29.96 billion from foreign sources.
Besides, the Senate President warned that no meanings should be read into his three visits to the Presidential Villa.
In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, Saraki said the Presidency’s proposed loan never came up in discussions with President Muhammadu Buhari and his deputy, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.
“The National Assembly, which I head as Senate President, has taken a position on the issue as required of it by the laws of the land and legislative conventions.
“At every point, the present National Assembly will make decisions based on national interest and we have vowed that we will always act in the interest of our people. That is why despite the fact that members belong to different parties, when national issues come to the floor we forget about party affiliations and act as Nigerians elected to protect the interest of Nigeria.
“A visit to the Presidency, by the Senate President, is normal because we need to consult, discuss, exchange ideas and make suggestions to each other from time to time.
“More importantly, at this time, when the nation is facing economic crisis, there is need for frequent engagements by the Presidency and the National Assembly.
“Politicians should stop playing to the gallery or drawing political capital from all issues. When serious national issues are on ground, we should refrain from making statements based on mere sentiments…”
Senate threw out Buhari’s foreign loan request on the ground that documents on repayment, loan sources and sectors where the loan would be spent were not attached to the covering correspondence from the president.
After the initial meeting with Buhari, the Presidency promised to resend the loan request which was yet to be done, as at yesterday.
