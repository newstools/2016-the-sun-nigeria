From Uche Usim, Abuja Minister of State, Aviation, Hadi Sirika, yesterday revealed that six Doppler Very-high Omni-directional Radios (VORs) and six Instrument Landing Systems with a collocated Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) are currently being installed in six airports across the country to boost air navigation. Speaking at the opening of the 24th meeting of Western and Central Africa Satellite Network Management Committee (SNMC) in Abuja yesterday, Sirika said the ministry had secured the government’s nod for the software and hardware upgrade and maintenance of the current Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria (TRACON) facility to make the system more efficient and interoperable with others. “Also in our strategic effort to enhance air navigation, a Controller Pilot Data Communication System (CPDLC) and an Automatic Dependent Surveillance Contract for Communication (ADS-C) was installed and commissioned on November 2015 at Lagos and Kano centres to provide strategic backup for the existing communication and surveillance systems,” he said. On the regional scene, the minister described the African and Indian Ocean Satellite Telecommunication Network (AFISNET) as the major contributor in the enhancement of safety and efficiency of air navigation within and across the African/Indian ocean region (AFI). “I commend the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the European Union, Alcatel, the Satellite Network Management Committee, Air Traffic Safety Engineers, Air Traffic Controllers and other stakeholders that have effectively sustained this safety critical network bridging aviation across the continents of the world,” he said. Also speaking at the event, the ICAO Regional Officer for Communication, Navigation and Surveillance CNS), Mr. Francois Xavier Salmbanga, said communication plays a crucial role in all the sectors of civil aviation, particularly in the provision of air navigation service.         Zamfara, only state without own university – NUC From Fred Ezeh, Abuja The National Universities Commission (NUC) has disclosed that out of 36 states of the federation, Zamfara is the only state without a university. The commission said the development could be responsible for the slow pace of economic, social and educational emancipation of the people, resulting in low human capital development. Speaking in Abuja yesterday, Executive Secretary of NUC, Professor Rasheed Abubakar, said, “it used to be Zamfara and Borno states, but the latter escaped recently following an approval for the state government to establish a state own university in Maiduguri.” He, therefore, challenged the Zamfara state government not to be left behind, but rather follow the footsteps of the other states, and prioritise education, in order to salvage the state from being perpetually tagged “educationally less developed state.” The NUC helmsman, however, promised to offer the needed expertise and support to the government to establish its own university, believing that such would argument the effort of the recently established Federal University in the state and also provide options and more opportunity for people who desires university education. Meanwhile, the state governor, Ibrahim Kashim, who led other state officials to receive the approval letter from NUC, promised to ensure that both academic and non-academic activities are in line with global best practices.
