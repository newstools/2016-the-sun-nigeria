By Judith Nwabia Nigeria’s unbeaten run in the Russia 2018 World Cup qualifiers has seen the Eagles soar to 50th place in the world in the November FIFA ranking released yesterday. The Eagles are now equally among Africa’s top 10 for the first time since 2015, just as Russia 2018 World Cup rivals Algeria and Cameroon dropped. Gernot Rohr’s men are now eighth in Africa behind Senegal, Cote d’Ivoire, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Congo DR and Burkina Faso; their reward for defeating Algeria 3-1 and Zambia 2-1 in their Fifa World Cup qualifying encounters. Algeria is now 38th in the world, three places down from their previous ranking, while Cameroon is 65th, six places below the position they enjoyed last month. Zambia moved to 91st position, three spots up from last month’s ranking. Argentina is number one in the world with 1634 points, closely followed by cross-country rivals, Brazil in number two. The December ranking will be the final ranking for 2016 and will reveal the winners for the Team of the Year (awarded to the team in first place by year’s end) and Mover of the Year (awarded to the team that has won the most points over the course of the year). The next FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking will be published on 22 December 2016. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s Super Eagles captain Mikel John Obi celebrated Nigeria’s up leap by tweeting via his handle, @mikel_john_obi: “#SuperEagles up another 10 places in the FIFA rankings.” Eagles goalkeeper, Daniel Akpeyi is also ecstatic about his side’s heartwarming improvement in the latest November Fifa ranking. “Whoa, that’s great, we are coming up strongly on the ladder!,” Akpeyi told SuperSports.
