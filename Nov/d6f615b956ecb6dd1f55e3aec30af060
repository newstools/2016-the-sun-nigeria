Nigeria Professional Football League winning Coach, Imama Amapakbo has once again reiterated his desire to see Nigerian League Legend, Victor Ezeji named an NPFL Ambassador by the League Management Company (LMC).
Amapakabo who won the just concluded NPFL season with Enugu Rangers Football Club was of the opinion that Ezeji remains one the best players the Nigerian League had ever produced and he should thus be so honoured.
The Rangers Coach who happened to have played with Ezeji as a player at Sharks and also coached him at the same club had earlier in August called on the LMC to name Ezeji as one of its ambassadors.
As Ezeji gets set to celebrate his much talked about testimonial in December, Amapakabo said there would be no better time than now to officially name a player whom younger players in the league consider an icon, an ‘Ambassador’ of the league.
“Who has won more than Victor Ezeji? He is a legend in his right. And I think it is about time the LMC made him an Ambassador of the league as opposed to someone who didn’t play in the league.
He won virtually everything in the land, highest goal scorer, MVP and more. He is the one that we see and he is the one that we know. He is the one the young players look up to.
There is no person that plays in the league today that does not know Victor Ezeji. Mention his name and you’ll see he is an idol. Is it because he is one of us? We should celebrate one of our own. I duff my hat to him.”
Imama Amapakabo was team captain when Victor signed up for the now defunct Sharks FC in 1996 and was a coach at Sharks when Ezeji returned for his third stint at the club between 2008-2012.
Ezeji from the time he began his top flight career in 1996 would then go on to play in 20 top flight seasons only halted for a brief spell when he tried his luck in Tunisia.
The Victor Ezeji Testimonial is scheduled to take place at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium in Port Harcourt on the 10th of December.
