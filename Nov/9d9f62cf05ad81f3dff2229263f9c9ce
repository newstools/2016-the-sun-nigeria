A housewife, Jelila Nurudeen, on Friday asked an Ojaoba Sharia Court, Ibadan, to put an end to the union with her husband, Nurudeen Olanrewaju, on grounds of sexual starvation for over seven years.
The mother of three in her petition alleged that her husband was subjecting her to emotional torture by starving her of sex for seven years.
“My lord, all the interventions made so far by this court have yielded no results as Olanrewaju has turned no new leaf.
“I may soon run mad if the court fails to separate us, because I can no longer withstand seven years of sexual drought.
“Should I start visiting the homes of some of the committee members set up to reconcile us to meet my sexual desire?
“Please I am ready to walk away from this union because Olanrewaju has already remarried to another wife, who is now satisfying his emotional desire,” Jelila explained.
However, Mr. Olanrewaju, who denied the allegation, rejected the divorce suit.
Mr. Olanrewaju who works at Nigerian Tobacco Company Ibadan, said he has been living happily with Jelila and promised to still make his wife happy.
The president of the court, Ahamad Tiamiyu, advised Jelila to give peace a chance by allowing the committee raised on the matter to do its work.
Mr. Tiamiyu adjourned the case till November 17, for progress report.
