(By Charity Okorie – IBADAN) Three suspected internet fraudsters, popularly known as ‘yahoo boys’, arrested by the Oyo State Police Command have confessed that they hypnotise their victims before defrauding them of their money. The suspects (Lanre Sadiq, 26; Sukanmi Daramola, 28; and Opeyemi Adedayo, 26) were picked up in their criminal hide out at Soka area, Ibadan by the command’s Anti-Kidnapping Squad (AKS). The suspects are said to have been elusive for some time before they were eventually arrested after several days of intelligence gathering and painstaking investigation carried out by the police. During interrogation, the suspects confessed to being internet fraudsters, adding that they had defrauded many innocent victims – whom they referred to as ‘clients’ – of their hard earned money in naira and foreign currencies. They also confessed that they often used charms to facilitate their illicit business. This they did by hypnotizing victims and ‘commanding’ them to part with their dollars and valuable properties. They further disclosed that those who had fallen victims included foreign nationals and Nigerians alike. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) for the command, Mr. Adekunle Ajisebutu, who confirmed the arrest, stated that until their arrest, the three suspects were “into cyber crime popularly known as yahoo plus.” The state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Samuel Adegbuyi, he said, had directed that a discreet investigation be carried out about their other activities, at the end of which they would be arraigned in court. He advised young people to shun crime, and to engage in legitimate business, even as he vowed to prosecute unrepentant criminals in the state. Exhibits recovered from the suspects include four laptops and an assortment of voodoo charms.
