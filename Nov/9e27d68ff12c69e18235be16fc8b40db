From Gyang Bere, Jos President of Church of Christ in Nations (COCIN), Rev. Dachollom Datiri, has pleaded with the National Assembly that, passing into a bill to legalise Shari’a into law, may ignite religious war in the country. Rev. Datiri stated this yesterday when he addressed clergymen at the 19st General Church Council meeting at the Church’s Headquarters, in Jos, capital of Plateau State. He said the National Assembly should have a rethink on the bill for Shari’a Law which has passed Second Reading and added that  inclusion of such law into the 1999 Constitution, as amended will lead to general collapse of the country. “It is no longer news that this bill has passed Second Reading and is being studied at the committee level. The committee handling this must look at it critically and consider all non-Muslims who will be affected by this law.” “It is clearly unconstitutional to force someone to adhere to a law that infringes on their (his or her) religious freedom. That could instigate people.” The clergy urged senators to resist the temptation of passing the bill in to law as the essence negate the corporate existence of the nation. He advocated for a total ban on the activities of a violent religious group (Shi’ite) in the country and commended Governor Lalong for taking the move in Plateau State.
