The Swiss are the richest people in the world, with an average wealth of 561,900 dollars per adult, Credit Suisse said in its annual global wealth report on Tuesday. This confirms Switzerland’s top ranking for the 16th year in a row. People in the United States trailed with assets worth 344,700 dollars, followed by the British average net worth of 288,800 dollars, the major Swiss bank said in Zurich. The depreciation of the pound that followed Britain’s vote to leave the EU has wiped out a total 1.5 trillion dollars of the country’s total privately held assets, Credit Suisse noted. For the first time since the global financial crisis of 2008, the global average wealth per adult stagnated in 2016, at 52,800 dollars. The report also showed that the share of people’s non-financial assets as part of their household wealth has increased for the first time this year since 2008. Rising real estate prices have added to private wealth in several countries including Germany, according to the report. The group of super-rich people, who own at least 50 million dollars, rose by 4,100 individuals to a total of 140,900 over the past year, driven by increases in Asian countries. (Source: NAN)
