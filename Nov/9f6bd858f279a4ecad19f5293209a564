The Senate on Tuesday pledged to engage relevant stakeholders to  avert  the warning strike being planned by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). ASUU had on Monday announced plans to embark on a one-week warning strike over the inability of government to implement agreements reached with it since 2009. The move by the Senate to intervene in the matter followed a motion moved by Sen. Jibrin Barau (APC-Kano North) under matters of urgent national importance. The President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, urged the chamber to intervene and ensure that the eight -year- agreement was fully implemented. “We must find a way of seeing to the implementation and we will look into the matter quickly. “We will also get the relevant parties to quickly come to the table so that we can find a way of moving forward and report back to us,” he said. While reading the motion, Sen. Jibrin Barau, who is Chairman of the Senate Committee on Tertiary Institutions and TetFund, urged government to implement all agreements. He also urged government to as well carry out certain actions that were necessary for the wellbeing of the development of Nigerian public universities. The lawmaker, however, commended ASUU for choosing the path of dialogue rather than confrontation as a means of resolving all the outstanding issues between it and the Federal Government. In his contribution, Sen. Danjuma Goje (APC-Gombe Central) noted that the history of strike in the country was a recurring decimal. “It is a disturbing issue to parents and students. There is need to nip it in the bud. We should not allow it to escalate,” Goje said. Goje said the motion was apt and and called on the senate to engage the leadership of ASUU in order to suspend its planned warning strike. The Majority Leader, Sen. Mohammed Ndume, described the senate as  a stabilising agent and called for the immediate intervention of the senate leadership in the matter. (Source: NAN)
