The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has issued Capital Oil and Gas Limited, a seven-day ultimatum to desist from the use of the association’s brand name, logo, and acronyms from its tank farm and retail outlets across the country.
IPMAN, in a statement signed by its National President, Mr. Chinedu Okoronkwo and National Secretary, Mr. Danladi Pasali, alleged that the purported agreement signed with Ifeanyi Ubah of Capital Oil and Gas Limited and some acclaimed IPMAN members is not with the knowledge of the National Executive of IPMAN.
‘‘It has, however, become very clear that Ifeanyi Ubah, who is not in any way a bonafide member of IPAMN is the one directly championing the crisis in IPMAN.IPMAN as an association must be bound by the laws of the land, hence the need to intimate members of the public of this recent development,’’ the statement said.
Going down memory lane, the association alleged that the infamous Kero-Direct scheme, wherein members were short changed should not be allowed to repeat itself under any guise whatsoever to deceive and rip off innocent members of the association
