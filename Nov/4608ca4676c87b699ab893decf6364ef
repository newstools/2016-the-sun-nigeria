Veteran journalist, Paul Bassey, who is billed to play the role of General Coordinator in the Guinea versus Congo DR Russia 2018 World Cup qualifier in Conakry this weekend has  resolved to remain at home to serve fatherland. Daily Sunsports can confirm that Bassey wont be in Conakry no thanks to a directive of the state government who want him to remain in Uyo and ensure that the state plays smooth host to the Nigeria, Algeria game. Bassey told Daily Sunsports yesterday that he has contacted FIFA to excuse him from the Guinea, Congo DR tie since national interest comes first. “We have a big game here in Uyo and the state government wants me to remain at home to help out in the organization of the Eagles, Algeria game. I have decided to comply in the interest of the state and country,” Bassey said. Bassey who was on duty in the CAF Champions League final involving Zamalek and Memolodi Sundowns in Alexandria a fortnight ago jokingly said: “Agreed this is the best time to earn dollar but national interest first.”
