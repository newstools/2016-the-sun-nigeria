Ndigbo Unity Forum (NUF) has urged the Federal and Enugu State governments to compensate the families that lost their loved in the April 25 invasion of Nimbo community in Enugu State.
The President of the forum, Augustine Chukwudum, NUF made the appeal in an interview with journalists  in Enugu on Monday.
Chukwudum said that government should be blamed for the invasion of Nimbo community in Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area by suspected herdsmen.
He noted that the successful attack and killing of about 50 people in the community was as a result of government’s inability to provide enough security in the area.
“The Federal and Enugu State government must bear the burden of the deaths and pay due compensation to the families of the deceased.
“This is because government has failed in its constitutional duty of protecting its people,’’ Chukwudum said.
He, therefore, called on South-East governors to pull resources together to put an end to unnecessary killings and terror within the zone.
He said that the forum condemned in strong term the “criminal invasion and killing of over 50 Nigerians in a peaceful and quiet Nimbo community without any iota of provocation.
“What we are seeing has shown that this crime against humanity is been committed with impunity.
“Security agencies have not taken concrete steps to apprehend and bring the perpetrators of these systematic killings in the South-East to book until the recent massive and breathe-taking one that happened in Nimbo community,’’ he said.
Chukwudum called on security agencies to arrest those involved in the crime, adding that the world and Nigerians were watching to see how the Nimbo case would be handled. (NAN)
