LAST week, news went viral that popular Yoruba actress, Funke Akindele, was tying the knot with the man after her heart, JJC Skillz of the 419 Squad. However, according to Entertainer checks, Steve Osagie, JJC’s manager who is also in London has cleared the air stat­ing clearly that his man is still very much single and hasn’t walked any woman down the aisle, just yet. ‘’Where did you get that news from? Nigerians and false information. JJC is not getting married today. Trust me, if he is, you would be amongst the first to know. In fact, I would have been in Nigeria by now, of the news was real,’’ Mr. Steve of Spotlight Management confided in GPM. However, the picture that kicked off the marriage rumour was from Jenifa’s Diary Season 6. The actress is going to get married in the next season of her comic TV drama.
