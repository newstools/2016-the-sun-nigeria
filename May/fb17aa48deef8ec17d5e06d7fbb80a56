There  were sporadic gunshots  at the Edo State House of Assembly Complex in Benin City on Tuesday. This followed the impeachment of the Speaker of the Assembly, Victor Edoror, and his deputy. This is the umpteenth time that the leadership of the House will be changing. Reports  say that it took the intervention of policemen to restore normalcy at the Assembly. The Speaker of the House, Honourable Victor Edoror and his Deputy were accused of incompetence and high-handedness. It is a 24-member Assembly and the two principal officers were impeached by 15 members. The former Speaker and his deputy came into office about a year ago. A new speaker Mrs Elizabeth Ative was elected after their impeachment as replacement.
