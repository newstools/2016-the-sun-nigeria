The political elite in the South-East geo-political zone have been warned of the danger of creating fathom political issues in the zone and blaming President Muhammadu Buhari for such.
“The current political configuration which had placed the South-East geo-political zone in the opposition was neither created nor caused by President Muhammadu Buhari as stated in a reaction by the Buhari South-East Youth Movement to some statements credited to some speakers in an anniversary lecture held by Alaigbo Development union in Enugu and reported by thisday newspaper of 28th May 2016.
In a release jointly  signed by the director-general of Buhari South-East Youth Movement (BUSEYM)Engr.Nwabueze Onwuneme and its national publicity secretary Comrade Igwe Samuel Obinna and made available to newsmen in Owerri the Imo state capital the group urged the region’s political leaders who have  not contributed to the socio-economic development  of the zone to apologise for their ineffectual leadership rather than resort to the blame game and weaving of fiction.
The group lamented that it is regrettable that some  Igbo elites said that the Buhari administration had relegated the Igbo to the background statting that even though the constitution admits freedom of assembly and speech and ordinarily it stated that it would not have joined issues with the proclamations made at the gathering but for the fact that the truth must be told and to shield the vulnerable from such misinformation. The group said it did not wish to join issues with some of the personalities who gathered recently in Enugu to make their assertions but would want to know how they arrived at this conclusion. BUSEYM said, it was regrettable that the elites failed to ask questions on the supposed developmental projects that should have accrued to the Igbo when the PDP was at the helm of affairs and totally neglected the zone as seen in the near collapse of infrastructure/socio-economic growth of the zone which would not have been brought about by  just one year in office of the APC led administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.
“Lest we forget in that era we had Igbo as Senate President,Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Minister of Finance and co-ordinating minister of the economy,Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria to mention but a few.
“But in those 16 years it is regrettable to note that  projects that were dear to the hearts of Igbos were not executed as seen in the Second Niger Bridge and Enugu-Onitsha which ditto  till now was not done till the advent of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration which just of recent backed words with action by the release of N13billion and N5.5b respectively for the projects”
BUSEYM maintained that while they would not cross swords with any individual/group, their position is that those seeeking relevance in the polity should come up with clearly stated programmes that would con tribute to the upliftment and betterment of the wellbeing of the people other than wiping up tribal/religious sentiments which has been the bane of the Nigerian nation and it’s people.
The group further maintained that President Buhari had been very fair in his treatment of all tribes in the nation and Ndi Igbo inclusive as seen with the appointment of six Igbo sons as Ministers in the federal executive council.
The group advised that rather than trade blames or fan the embers of disunity, Igbo elites should re-strategise and re-allign their political objectives and jettison platforms and personalities who had had their turn, but failed to deliver.The group also used the occasion to congratulate and encourage President Muhammadu Buhari on his one year on the saddle and encouraged him to be steadfast and always seek the face of God in all his ac tions and most importantly stay away from the counsel of the wicked and ungodly  men stating that Nigerians most especially the downtrodden whom has been imporvished by bad leadership and corruption in the past are solidly behind him.
