From Isaac Anumihe, Abuja Following revelations in the course of the trial of the former Chief of Defence Staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, at the Federal High Court, Abuja, that the sum of N558.2 million was allegedly diverted monthly from the Nigeria Air Force account into private pockets, the Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, has directed an investigation into the payrolls of the Air Force, the Navy and the Army by the Continuous Audit Team of the Federal Government.
Director of Information, Ministry of Finance, Salisu Na’Inna Dambatta, said that the continuous audit team has been charged with the responsibility of scrutinising the payrolls of the three services, which have not yet been put on the  Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS),  to ensure that all possible loopholes that could lead to leakages were blocked.
According to him, the  exercise will be conducted pending the biometric capturing and migrating the payroll of the three services to the IPPIS, in line with the policy of the Federal Government to clean up the payroll of all public sector employees.
The Minister of Finance said that the measure has become necessary as part of the change mantra of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, which includes the restoration of the culture of transparency, accountability and control in the management of public funds.
However, the  Continuous Audit Process was one of the initiatives of the Minister approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, in line with the on-going reforms in the public finance management system of the Federal Government, which he emphasised in his 2016 Budget speech.
Adeosun said the Director of Special Projects in the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Mohammed Kyari Dikwa, will head the Continuous Audit Team and report their findings for appropriate action by government.
