From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), David Babachir Lawal has said appointments into political offices is the sole prerogative of President Muhammad Buhari.
In a statement issued in Abuja yesterday, Lawal said the clarification followed reports that his office had been extorting money from candidates seeking appointment into boards of parastatals and agencies.
The report stated that applicants pay between N50 million to N100 million for appointments into federal boards and parastatals.
“The office of the SGF wishes to first clarify that it does not make political appointments, including those into boards of parastatals as this is the prerogative of the president.
“The office is also not involved in employment activities, which is the responsibility of the Federal Civil Service Commission or the respective agencies, as the case may be.
“For appointment of boards of federal government parastatals and agencies, there is a presidential committee and its memberships are drawn from the six geo-political zones of the federation,” the statement said.
Lawal added that the committee, which liaised with all the states of the federation, had no official of the office of the SGF as member.
He explained that the committee was the only body saddled with responsibility of identifying and recommending qualified and eligible nominees for board appointments for consideration by the president.
He said the committee is composed of men of unimpeachable integrity and honesty in whom the president reposes unqualified confidence to carry out this assignment to his satisfaction.
