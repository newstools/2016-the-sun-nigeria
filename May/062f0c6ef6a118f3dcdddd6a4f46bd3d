Viewers were once again treated to a spectacular blend of entertainment and display of talent, as aspiring singers thrilled coaches and fans alike in the episode six of The Voice Nigeria, which is being sponsored by Airtel Nigeria.
Sundayâ€™s episode saw Team Tubaba win over the silky voiced Obed Ogbonna and the petite songstress, Precious. Team Waje continued their impressive streak as they won over male vocalists, Promise and Uche Michael, while Team Patoranking scored with Benjamin and Team Timi successfully wooed Kofo.
Highlights of the show included the performance by visually impaired Adim, who inspired a rousing applause from the audience for his courage, and opera singer Amanda, who could not garner support from the coaches despite a sterling performance.
At the end of the episode, the teams were neck deep in competition with Team Waje leading the pack with 11 talents. Team Tubaba, Team Patoranking and Team Timi had 10 talents each.
