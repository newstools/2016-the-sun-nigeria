The Lagos State Government had received investment propositions worth 43 billion dollars in the last one year. Prof. Ademola Abass, the Special Adviser to Governor Akinwunmi Ambode on Overseas Affairs and Investment, disclosed this on Thursday in Lagos when he briefed newsmen on the `Lagos Global’ platform. The  office was created by the governor to work toward making Lagos the most desirable investment destination in the world. The office is also expected to enhance the ease of doing business in Lagos. Abass said that the state government had approved many of the proposals and 139 of them were currently at various stages of consideration by the office. According to him, the approved investment proposals cover six sectors – environment, infrastructure, health, manufacturing, real estate and transportation. Abass said that the office was working to ensure that investors, who desired to invest in the state, enjoyed a seamless and hurdle-free atmosphere. “Proposals are usually attended to within 48 hours,” he said. Abass said that the current World Bank Index on Ease of Doing Business ranked Nigeria 169 out of 189 nations, with Lagos constitutes 77 per cent of the determining factors. According to him, Lagos is the fifth largest economy in Africa and has remained the choice investment destination. Abass said that the state government had put premium on strengthening the rule of law and security sector reforms. He also declared that Lagos State was, undoubtedly, one of the safest states in Nigeria. (NAN)
