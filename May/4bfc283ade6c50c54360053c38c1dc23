FORMER Nigeria captain, Joseph Yobo is pleased to have secured the commit­ment of major international players to take part in his testimonial game later this month in Port Harcourt. Yobo, 35, had been in Europe, visiting his old playing grounds and speaking to players expected at the game and he was happy at the overwhelming response “It has been amazing. Almost every­body wants to come and play,” he said. “My only regret is that I can’t invite everybody.” At Everton where he spent nearly a decade of his playing career, Yobo was warmly received by the entire club and presented to a stadium-wide ova­tion from the fans at half time of their Premier League game against Bour­nemouth. “That was an emotional moment for me. And I would like to thank Evertoni­ans for the love.” The Testimonial, on May 27, would be hosted by the Rivers State Government at the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium. Yobo made 101 appearances for the Super Eagles and played at three World Cups, while winning one Africa Cup of Nations title at South Africa in 2013.
