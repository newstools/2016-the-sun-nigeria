By Judith Nwabia Michel Platini has made known his intention to resign as UEFA president at the organization’s next congress as a result of the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s decision to retain his ban from football activity. Platini who was handed a six years ban, reduced to four years by CAS’ three-man appeal panel- relating to a $2 million (£1.3m) disloyal payment made by then FIFA chief, Sepp Blatter in 2011, denied any wrong doing and had maintained optimism, prior to Friday’s ruling, towards having his punishment annulled. He expressed in a statement released by his lawyers that he was deeply disappointed by the injustice of the decision and was now ready to resign. UEFA’s Executive Committee had fixed May 18 to meet and begin the process of replacing Platini. Their statement read: “UEFA has taken note of the decision of the Court of Arbitration for Sport to suspend UEFA President Michel Platini from any football-related activity for four years. “We have also taken note of Michel Platini’s statement announcing his intention to resign as UEFA President. The UEFA Executive Committee will meet on the morning of 18 May in Basel to discuss next steps, including the scheduling of an elective congress. “In the meantime, there will be no UEFA President appointed ad interim.” Platini’s original eight-year ban was reduced to six by a FIFA appeals panel, with the 60-year-old then taking his case to CAS in February.
