The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Enugu State on Tuesday elected Mr Augustine Nnamani as its chairman for the next four years.
Nnamani, a former Local Government Chairman of Isiuzo, was returned unopposed through a `Yes’ vote by delegates.
He polled 954 votes out of the 984 votes cast at the state congress of the PDP held at the Michael Okpara Square, Enugu.
Inaugurating the new party executives, Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State warned against any form of division in the state chapter of the party.
Ugwuanyi said that it was time members of the PDP in the state give peace a chance in order to move forward, stressing that the leadership must carry everyone along. “You must approach your duties with due commitment and fervour. Everyone in the party is important and you must give them chance to play their roles as party members,” he said.
In his address, the Deputy Senate President, Chief Ike Ekweremadu said that the smooth conduct of the congress had put the party in a better pedestal to achieve success.
Ekweremadu said that the aspiration of the founding father of Enugu State was peace, and peace was achieved at the congress.
“With due respect to past state party chairmen in the state, Mr Ikeje Asogwa, has emerged as the most successful because he is handing over a most peaceful state to the new chairman.
“I remember at a time in the state we had the Okwesilieze Nwodo and Chimaroke Nnamani faction. At other time we had the Abuja and Enugu groups and finally the Sullivan Chime group and Ike Ekweremadu faction.
“But today, we only have the Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi group in Enugu State and we are going to give the governor our result in the year 2023 when we present our certificate to him,” Ekweremadu said.
Other members of the new party executive include Mr Cletus Akalusi, Secretary; Dr Christian Iyiani , Organising Secretary, while the only female member, Mrs Vera Ezugwu emerged as the Woman Leader. (NAN)
