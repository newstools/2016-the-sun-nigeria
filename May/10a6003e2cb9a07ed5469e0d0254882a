FORMER governor of Abia State, Dr. Orji Kalu has extolled children as part of activities marking the 2016 Children’s Day celebrations. Kalu pointed out that children remain Nigeria’s hope just as he slammed elders for the permissive rot in the society. Dr. Kalu regretted that “elders of today were not showing good examples for our children and wards to emulate. All that our young ones get innundated with are stories of mind-boggling corruption, insurgency, terrorism, banditry, pipeline vandalism, collapse of social infrastructure and desecretion of sacred places of worship. There is no good news from elderly members of this generation,” Dr. Kalu said. According to the former governor, “We (the elders) must turn a new leaf so that children of today can have something laudable to look forward to as they prepare to lead this country very soon. There is no doubt that shortly from now a new set of leaders comprising the current youth will emerge to take over the administration of this country.” In a statement issued by his media adviser, Mr. Ebere Wabara, in commemoration of the 2016 Children’s Day, Dr. Kalu implored mature Nigerians to leave legacies ahead of inevitable retirement from active life.
