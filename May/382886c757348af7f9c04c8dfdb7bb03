BY PAUL EREWUBA ENYIMBA moved to the second position in the Nigeria Professional Football League table following a hard fought 2-1 win over Warri Wolves at the Umuahia Township Stadium yes­terday. The Peoples’ El­ephants are now on 30 points, one behind lead­ers, Rivers United but with two games in hand. Yesterday’s game was the first time Enyimba’s head coach, Paul Aigbo­gun, would be facing his former club. Enyimba also parad­ed three former Warri Wolves players in Ike­chukwu Ibenegbu, Ike ThankGod and Abu Azeez in her starting line-up, while two oth­ers, Musa Najare and Joseph Osadiaye, started on the bench. Wolves coach Ard Sluis made two changes to the side that defeated El-Kanemi Warriors 1-0 on matchday 19 with centre- back Semiu Li­adi and Shedrack Oguh replacing Obinna Nwo­kolo and Sikiru Alimi. The host started the game on a bright note with Christian Pyagbara scoring the opening goal on 55 seconds. Wolves recovered from the setback and equalized through Oguh in the 39th minute fol­lowing an error by ThankGod. Enyimba restored her lead in the 72nd minute through Andrew Aba­logu who tapped in from close range after goal­keeper Tejiri Rhiogbere spilled Chima Akas’ free kick. Warri Wolves were re­duced to 10-men three minutes later after Solo­mon Okpako was sent off for a poor tackle on Ibenegbu. Akas came close to doubling his side’s lead in the 78th minute but his beautiful free kick hit the woodwork. Enyimba is now with­out defeat in her last nine games in the NPFL. Meanwhile, the NPFL champion and CAF Champions League con­tender, Enyimba, will confront another NPFL side, El-Kanemi War­riors, in the Round of 32 of this year’s Federation Cup competition. Also, FC IfeanyiUbah and last year’s runner-up Lobi Stars will do battle, while Cup holder Akwa United takes on Kwara United. The matches are billed for Wednesday, 15th June and Thursday, 16th June, 2016.
