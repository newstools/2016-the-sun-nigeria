Niger Delta Liberation Force (NDLF), a militant group has said it is not afraid of President Muham­madu Buhari as he “is not God” that the “boys in the creek” would be afraid of. The group, which benefitted from the amnesty programme of former President Goodluck Jona­than, said as at the time they surrendered their weapons, they told the world that bombing of pipe­lines was not over. NDLF asked the president to sack Paul Boroh, co­ordinator of the presidential amnesty programme, if he wants to be in control of the “current oil war. “We do not condemn the current bombing be­cause when we surrendered, we told the world that bombing of pipelines was not over yet,” Mark Anthony, spokesman of the group, said in a state­ment. “Those bombing pipelines in Delta state should not behave like cowards if they are truly fighting the interest of Niger Delta. “They should be bold enough to come out. When we were bombing, our leader General John Togo did not hide his face. We dealt with the Nigerian army, and we were not hiding. “They should not hide their identity. Buhari is not God and they should not be scared of him. JTF should not attack and arrest innocent people in Ijaw communies, they should go for the real sabo­tuers.
