From Chidi Nnadi and Petrus Obi, Enugu DEPUTY Senate Presi­dent, Ike Ekweremadu and South-East gover­nors rose from a meeting and demanded the Fed­eral Government reha­bilitate federal roads in the South East. Besides, they com­mended President Mu­hammadu Buhari for signing the 2016 budget into law. Ekweremadu and the governors met with some of their predeces­sors in Enugu, largely considered to be the capital of the South East. The meeting, which was held at the Enugu Government House, had in attendance the host Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Ebonyi State governor, Dave Umahi, Abia State governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, for­mer Imo governor Ikedi Ohakim, former Anam­bra governor, Peter Obi and Ekweremadu who briefed the newsmen. The deputy Senate President said Gover­nors Rochas Okorocha of Imo State and Wil­lie Obiano of Anambra State, who were not at yesterday’s meeting or­ganised to review events at Ukpabi Nimbo in Uzo- Uwani loca government area, where suspected herdsmen attacked the people, would be in Enu­gu when they reconvene in the weeks ahead. He said they were happy that the budget has been signed into law and expect the much talked about change to begin to bear fruit. Spe­cifically, Ekweremadu disclosed they reviewed award of road contracts in the South-East and re­gretted that, in the past, contracts were awarded to incompetent contrac­tors, leading to most of them not executed. Ekweremadu gave the names of the roads they discussed to include Enugu-Onitsha, Enugu- Port Harcourt and Aba- Ikot Ekpene Expressway. He said they decided to follow up with the Fed­eral Ministry of Works on the eastern roads to be sure that Ndigbo, this time around, “would be given a sense of belong­ing.” They also commended Ugwuanyi on how he managed the Nimbo attack and added that the governor told them those who were dis­placed have returned home.
