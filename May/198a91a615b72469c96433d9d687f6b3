Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose has said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) South-West zonal congress slated for tomorrow, in Akure, Ondo State, will hold as scheduled.
The governor told newsmen at the PDP national secretariat in Abuja, yesterday, that materials for the congress had been distributed through the appropriate authority.
He said the party was not aware of any court order stopping the congress and as such, machinery is in motion for a hitch-free congress.
“I can confirm that materials for the congress have been handed to the committee and the committee is set for the congress.
“Anyone talking about court order is only deceiving himself and, it is now time for the party to operate, devoid of any abracabra court orders.
“I, therefore, urge all delegates and leaders of our party to converge on Akure tomorrow for the congress as scheduled,” the governor said.
Calling on elders of the party to take the backstage and play advisory role, the governor said: “Those who have occupied exalted positions in the party should be ready to bow out graciously for the emergence of new blood burning with ideas, especially the youths who are not Abuja-based but popular at home.
“In as much as we respect and appreciate all our elders, they must act in a way that the overall interests of our party and its members will not be jeopardised.”
He said the era of people forcing themselves on the party, using court orders is gone and anyone interested in party positions must be ready to face elections.
