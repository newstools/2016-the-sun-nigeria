Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State is in trouble  as  Ndigbo Unity Forum, an Igbo socio-cultural group,  has  given  him an ultimatum of 60 days to pay workers outstanding salaries and allowances.
This is contained in a statement signed by the President of the forum, Mr Augustine Chukwudum, and made available to journalists in Enugu on Sunday. It described as unfortunate that after receiving bailout funds from the Federal Government, which the governors and their cabinet agreed was enough to settle workers, would divert such money.
The statement said such action was the height of insensitivity in a democratic setting that holds a lot of good promises for the people.
“On South East, we observed that the Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo state notwithstanding bailout funds that runs into billions that he received from the Federal Government that he still owes workers in the state many months salary.
“We demand that Gov. Rochas Okorocha should pay workers in Imo state their salary within sixty days,’’ it said.
The statement warned that coalition of civil societies would soon mobilise for the mother of all demonstration in Imo, if the governor failed to heed to the advice. (NAN)
