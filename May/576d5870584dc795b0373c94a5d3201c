The Director of the Nigerian Foreign Service Academy, Mr Benedict Adejinle, said on Tuesday that there was a growing interest by some countries in training their nationals in his
organisation in Lagos. Adejinle told journalists in Lagos that countries, including Namibia, Kenya, Switzerland and Argentina, had indicated interest in the academy’s Foreign Service Officers training programme. “This Academy was established primarily to train Nigeria Foreign Service Officers and prepare them for diplomatic practice at home and overseas. “The Foreign Service Academy, despite the current economic challenges, has continued to fulfill its objective of training Foreign Service Officers for Nigeria. “This is evident in the increasing number of students at the academy’s regular
courses, over the years. “It is also gladdening to know that a lot interest is being shown by the Foreign Service Institutes of Namibia, Kenya, Switzerland, Argentina and others in our Academy,’’ he said. The official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said that there was already an existing exchange programme between Nigeria and Switzerland in equipping diplomats to meet global challenges. He said that the exchange programme was usually for a period of two weeks, during which the students were exposed to the practical aspects of their responsibilities as Foreign Service officers. The director said that the students were planning to embark on a self-sponsored study tour of South Africa and the Republic of Benin, for exposure to the practical aspects of their profession. He also announced plans by the academy to introduce conference diplomacy, media diplomacy, as well as receptions and formal dinners to its curriculum. Adejinle said that the academy had in August 2015 graduated 107 students through its 21st Regular Course, adding that there was currently another set of 107 students undergoing training at the academy.
