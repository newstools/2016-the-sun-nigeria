HE is a fighter and he stands by whatever he believes in no matter whose Ox is gored. Re­member those days when he inspired Nigerians by spearheading a number of NLC strikes that practically crippled the nation under ex-presi­dent Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration. Even as governor of Edo State, he is known for his no nonsense approach. Though a loving and devout father to his kids, another side of the Edo State governor is begin­ning to emerge since he married his Ethiopian love, Lara. The Edo State governor and his wife have become an item at political events and social cir­cles across Nigeria. Sources say that Oshiomhole never misses any opportunity to flaunt his wife. “What a lot of Nigerians don’t know is that Adams Oshiomhole is a romantic man. Ever since he got married to his new bride, Lara, from Ethiopia, he has totally become a transformed man. “In fact, he always wants her by his side where ever he goes. Lara is such a beautiful babe and Oshiomole makes sure that at any given oppor­tunity he does not fail to flaunt his wife before his friends and associates. In fact, she is like his hand bag and makes sure that she is always by her side where ever he goes whether attending state dinners or even official business. He knows that he is married to a beautiful wife and he enjoys flaunting her where ever he goes.” Shortly after their wedding 11 months ago, the governor had declared that his wife was a virgin when he married her. Hear him: “I can boldly tell all of you that I was a very principled man during my first marriage. I didn’t succumb to the worldly pleasures of this lustful environ­ment even though I had lots of opportunities. And it was this principled sobriety that made me fish for a virgin wife.”
