From Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha INDIGENOUS People of Biafra (IPOB) under the leadership of Mr. Nnam­di Kanu has condemned comments credited to Mr. Debe Odumegwu Ojuk­wu, one of the sons of the late Biafra warlord, Chief Chukwuemeka Odumeg­wu Ojukwu that Kanu was not the group’s leader. The group stated that Debe’s statements showed he was not properly in­formed about the move­ment and restoration of Biafra. “We regret that somebody from the fam­ily of the former Biafra leader, late Chukwueme­ka Odumegwu Ojukwu or one of the sons made this type of uninformed state­ment.” In a statement by the Media and Publicity Sec­retary of IPOB, Mr. Emma Powerful stated that Debe Ojukwu worked for Bilie that had sympathy for the All Progressives Congress (APC). According to Powerful: “The question is where and when did he start IPOB ? Does he recall when Nnamdi Kanu was visiting his residence at Lekki Phase 1 in Yoruba land with the publisher of Eastern Pilot newspaper to ask him to join IPOB? This man must be shown where he belongs and not IPOB and he should stop ridiculing himself. “Was it not the same Nnamdi Kanu that used Radio Biafra to defend him when Ojukwu’s chil­dren said his mother was not married to the late Odumegwu Emeka Ojuk­wu and as such labelled him no body in the soci­ety. Without the inter­vention of Nnamdi Kanu on Radio Biafra, he Debe would have been found nowhere today. “Debe should be asked where and when he con­tributed to Radio Biafra formation and IPOB. He has brought shame to the revered Ojukwu’s name and family all because of political opportunism,” Powerful stated. He continued: “How many IPOB meetings has he Debe attended? Does he know we have IPOB family meeting in the same Lekki where he lives? How come he has never attended any IPOB meeting either in Nigeria or abroad? Debe should join the Director of Pub­lic Prosecution of Nigeria to try and condemn our leader so that way, he and Ikedife can get their job and contracts.”
