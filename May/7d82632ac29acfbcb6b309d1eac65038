As the organised labour is warming up for a confrontation with the Federal Government on the new pump price of petrol, an elder statesman and the Chairman of the Yoruba Unity Forum (YUF), Bishop Bolanle Gbonigi, at the weekend appealed to the organised labour in the county to shelve their planned industrial action. Gbonigi, the retired Bishop of the Akure Diocese of the Anglican Communion, urged labour to be patient with the current administration, noting that the recent removal of oil subsidy was a right step taking by the government to rescue the country from its current economic challenges. The clergyman spoke in Akure, Ondo State, while speaking at a public presentation of two books written by a journalist and staff member of the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria, Mr. Oye Agunbibiade. The octogenarian urged Nigerians to support President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration on the removal of fuel subsidy. “The oil subsidy removal was long overdue and Nigerians should commend the present administration for having the courage to take the bold step”, he said.
