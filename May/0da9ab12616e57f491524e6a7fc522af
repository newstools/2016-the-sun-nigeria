THE Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has called on the national leadership of the party and the presidency to wade into what it described as “ugly trend in the ongoing campaign ahead the governorship primary in the state. In a statement signed by the State publicity secretary, Mr. Godwin Erhahon, the party also sympathized with all victims of the violent attack on the gubernatorial aspiration campaign team of Deputy Governor, Dr Pius Odubu at Auchi, headquarters of Esako West Local Government Area last weekend. The statement reads: “APC expresses gratitude to God for preventing death so far from the attack and pray for speedy recovery for those who were wounded by gun shots from the hoodlums. We apologize to the victims and the public for the statements of some of our officials who sounded sadistic and conspiratorial in a feeble but self-indicting attempt to trivialize the near tragic incident. “Their reckless and ungodly utterances do not represent the culture of APC. “ It is saddening that these heartless officials could not sympathize with those who were wounded in the attack. “The party also lauded all the other gubernatorial aspirants who have openly condemned the attack even as it appealed to “the good people of Edo South to resist the temptation of viewing the attack on their illustrious son as an ethnic plot knowing that godly leaders from Auchi and other parts of Edo North have unanimously condemned the attack.”
