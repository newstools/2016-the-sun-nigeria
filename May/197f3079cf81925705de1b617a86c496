BY MONICA IHEAKAM MANCHESTER City starlet, Kelechi Iheanacho’s father, James, is optimistic that his son will continue to shine like a million stars under the tutelage of incoming manager, Pep Guardiola. This optimism from the proud Dad is coming just as Kelechi admitted that Pep’s arrival this summer will make him a better player. “Kelechi will definitely play under Guardiola and I am sure of that,” James Iheanacho told AfricanFootball.com“He has done well whenever he has been given opportunities this season and I am sure the new coach will want to work with him.” The 19-year-old Nigeria international finished his debut season by scoring his 14th goal in a 1-1 draw at Swansea City to virtually assure Champions League football for Guardiola’s first campaign. The striker’s contract with the club runs until the summer of 2019, though his agent is in talks with City for a new and hugely improved deal at the Etihad. Iheanacho is grateful to current City boss Manuel Pellegrini for giv- ing him his opportunity in the first team. He made a huge impact in his first season — averaging a goal every 92 minutes — and the Nigerian striker is hoping he has caught the eye of Bayern Munich coach, Guardiola. “There is a great manager coming in and you have to be happy about that,” Iheancho told reporters. “We will work with him and he will be choosing the players he wants to work with next season so it’s a case of working hard and seeing what happens. “Pep is a great manager who has coached some big teams in Europe and won a lot of trophies. I think he will do the same for us as well.”
