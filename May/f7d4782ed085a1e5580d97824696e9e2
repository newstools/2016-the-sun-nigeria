BY JOE APU NIGERIA remains in the same 67th position in the latest FIFA rankings and outside the top 10 among African countries according to the May 5 release from the world soccer ruling body. Not a single position  changed at the top 50, with Argentina still in the lead ahead of Belgium, Chile, Colombia and Germany. The Super Eagles are now the 14th best African side behind Algeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Senegal, Egypt, Cape Verde, Tuni sia, Congo DR, Guinea, Congo, Cameroon, Morocco and Mali. Algeria remains at the  summit of African football  with 771 points which put her in the 33rd position in the world while African champion Cote d’Ivoire is second in Africa and ranked 34th in the world. The Super Eagles of Nigeria will have a chance to begin her resurgence after failing to make the AFCON 2017 finals billed for Gabon  when they face Mali on May 27 in France. It will also afford Mali’s coach  Alain Giresse the opportunity to test his evolving squad against the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations winners. Giresse already has embarked on a recruitment drive of youthful players ahead of the clash. Despite being a strong defensive unit, Mali surely has some great attacking options that will worry the Super Eagles when the two sides clash.
