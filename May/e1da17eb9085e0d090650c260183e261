From Taiwo Amodu, Abuja Chairmen of State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs), yesterday, gave indication of their willingness to use card readers in conduct of elections at the local level.
Chairman of Forum of SIECs, Mrs Gloria Ukpong, who stated this at a meeting with the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC), Professor Mohammed Yaquub, in Abuja, requested the assistance of INEC in that regard.
“We are seeking INEC assistance for us to collaborate in use of card reader. If we use same register, we think we can also use card reader,” she said.
Mrs Ukpong, chairman of Akwa-Ibom SIEC, further disclosed that some states had problem using INEC voters’ register. “After three or four years, there should be update of voters’ register. It is a challenge in most states.” In his remarks, INEC chairman assured that his commission would be willing to assist SIECs to adopt the technology already in use by INEC. “The time has come for states to adopt the technology introduced by INEC. We can’t continue to rely on analogue method. We must introduce modern technology in the conduct of local elections in this country. It will safeguard the process and give it credibility. So, whatever we can do to strengthen the process at the local level, we shall continue to do within our limited resources,” the INEC boss assured.
