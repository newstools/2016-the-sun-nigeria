From Dennis Mernyi, Abuja THE acting Chairman of Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), Dr. Anthony Akah, has charged the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) to meter all its 732,423 customers with immediate effect. Speaking at Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital, at the inauguration of the Abakaliki Forum Office, the NERC boss said the rising complaints over estimated billing resulting from the wide metering gap in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) by the EEDC will no longer be accepted. “EEDC has about 732,423 and about 512,335 of them representing over 70 per cent are un-metered, a development that is unacceptable for quality service delivery,” he stated. He said the Commission is closely monitoring EEDC and other electricity distribution companies to ensure that the metering gap in NESI, estimated at about 50 per cent was eliminated within the shortest possible time. According to him, available statistics with the Commission indicates that the present metering gap in Enugu Disco alone is about 512,335 when compared to its total customer size of 732,423.
