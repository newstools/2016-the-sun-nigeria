The Dream Team is to approach tomorrow’s semi final clash against Germany with a different match plan aimed at ensuring that free scoring Germany fires blank.
While perfecting their strategy, the players begged not to be distracted by Team Nigeria officials led by Solomon Dalung ahead of the all- important match.
Some keys players insisted that they didn’t want the Sports Minister, Solomon Dalung, and his delegation anywhere near their dressing room before and during the match to avoid unnecessary distractions.
“We are set for the semi final clash with Germany. We have perfected our game plan to qualify for the final and win the gold medal for Nigeria like our 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games colleagues,” hinted one of the players.
He added: “We are going to approach the game differently as that is the only way to stop the Germans from scoring.”
Germany had scored a total of 20 goals before reaching tomorrow’s semi. The Germans whitewashed Fiji by 10-0 and hammered Portugal 4-0 in the quarter final.
Despite the apology by Dalung for the shabby manner his ministry treated the team during their training tour of Atlanta, USA, the Dream Team players insisted that it was difficult for them to forget the scenario before achieving the feat of reaching the semi final.
Dream Team players and officials were stranded for three days before being airlifted by American Delta Airline to Manaus, venue of their first group game against Japan.
Dalung had also said he knew nothing about the Atlanta training tour declaring that the Atlanta trip was nothing but “child trafficking.”
