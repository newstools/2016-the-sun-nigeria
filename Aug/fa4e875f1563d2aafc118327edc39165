By Ola Kehinde-Balogun Ijaw National Congress (INC) has distanced itself from all agitations by some activists’ groups in the region to declare a Niger Delta Republic.
INC said it had cautioned many of the groups that “are popping up like mushrooms” to desist from unilaterally taking such steps without due consultations with various ethnic groups that made up the region. It said such agitations  are inimical to the growth of Niger Delta and the country at large.
In a statement signed by National Publicity Secretary, Pastor Victor Burubo, INC warned President Muhammadu Buhari to avoid dialoguing with myriad of groups whose voices do not represent the authentic position of true ethnic nationalities in the Niger Delta.
“Congress has not deliberated on such an issue, neither have we heard of any ethnic nationality that supports the position of Niger Delta Republic.”
Burubo, who stated that their main concern remains the issues of injustice and marginalization of their people, affirmed that President Buhari has not given a due reassurance to their plights. This, he said, has made agitations and restiveness to blossom rather than abate.
The group also called on the general public to be wary of one Mr. Boma Obuoforibo, whom it said is no longer the president of INC.
“It is bad for public morality for anyone to pretend that being removed from office for gross misconduct can be accepted, tolerated and publicly embraced. It is infinitely saddening that those selected Ijaw elders that met in Warri allowed politicians to arm-twist them into pretending that Barrister Boma Obuoforibo is the president of INC after his impeachment,” he added.
