Waidi “Skoro” Usman, winner of the best boxer award at GOtv Boxing Night 8, has expressed readiness to fight Uganda’s Edward “Shaka” Kakembo, who beat him to the African featherweight title at GOtv Boxing Night 6 last December.
Skoro, who won the N1million cash prize for the best boxer on account of his defeat of David “Lucky Boy” Ekpeyong, said he is in the right shape to beat Kakembo and claim the continental title.
“I’m ready for Kakembo. He will see a different Skoro whenever we meet. I’m fitter and I have worked on the gaps in my boxing. Kakembo will fall,” he said.
On being adjudged the best boxer, Skoro said his gratitude went to his fans, who cheered him all through his fight with Ekpeyong.
“My fans cheered me non-stop and I thank them for believing in me despite the fact that I lost the chance to win the African featherweight title to Edward Kakembo of Uganda in December.
“I intend to repay their trust in me by beating Kakembo anytime there is a rematch. There will be no hiding place for him,” he boasted.
