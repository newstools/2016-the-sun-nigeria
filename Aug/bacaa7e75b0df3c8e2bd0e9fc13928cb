From Paul Osuyi, Asaba INDICATIONS have emerged that the Delta State Government will on September 5 present staff of office to the 17-year-old king of Ubulu-Uku Kingdom in Aniocha South Local Government Area of the state, Obi Noah Chukwukah Akaeze I.
Akaeze I succeeded his father, Obi Edward Akaeze Ofulue III, who was kidnapped and murdered by suspected herdsmen in January.
Meanwhile, Onishe of the kingdom, Chief Emma Ejiofor, has protested the presentation, contending that Akaeze I was not the right heir to the throne on the grounds that Ofulue III allegedly usurped the throne of his elder half brother, Okuchukwu, who was an half cast.
But the state government insisted that the protest against Akaeze Iâ€™s enthronement was not known to it, hence it would go ahead with the ceremony, following what it called the conclusion of all traditional rites by the community.
Feelers from government quarters indicated that it had earlier issued a letter of recognition to the new king on the recommendation of Ubulu-Uku Council of Chiefs, the Council of Traditional Rulers of Aniocha South Local Government Area and the executive chairman of the local government council.
Secretary to the Ubulu-Uku Royal Palace and Obi-in-Council, Mr. Joe Obazei, said the coronation of Akaeze I was delayed due to the manner of the passage of Ofulue III after his kidnap.
Obazei, in a statement, urged indigenes of the kingdom in Nigeria and the diaspora to see the coronation as a homecoming and rally round the new king.
The police and other security agencies, he said, still had a duty of giving justice to the people by prosecuting the persons connected with the kidnap and murder of the late king.
