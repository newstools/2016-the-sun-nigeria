The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) candidate, Osaro Onaiwu, has pledged to develop the abandoned International Money Market cited in a 1000 by 1000km space of land at Oregbeni-Ogbesan quarters  in Ikpoba-Okha local government area.
Onaiwu, who made the promise during his campaign tour to the locality, observed that the building has been abandoned since 1996 by successive administrations; a trend he said would change if voted into office as governor.
He stated that when fully developed and utilized, the international money market will add value to the state infrastructural development as well as boost its Internally Generated Revenue.
While soliciting for votes from residents in the area, he promised to fix the road leading to the market, adding that he would provide medical centre, fire service and a police post within the market for a more conducive business environment.
Meanwhile, the APGA in Edo State has cautioned the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its supporters against violence in the build up to the September 10 election in the state.
The governorship candidate gave the warning in Benin City after some supporters of the APC were alleged to have attacked and assaulted supporters of APGA in Upper Sokponba area of Benin.
He frowned at the development, stating that attacking supporters of other political parties is not a practice of democracy and as such is condemnable in all its entirety.
