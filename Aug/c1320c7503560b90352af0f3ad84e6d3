The Peoples Democratic Party’s gubernatorial candidate in Ondo State, Mr Eyitayo Jegede (SAN) has promised to initiate economic policies that will make the state less dependent on Federal allocation even as he wants  to ensure the recently approved Ilaje Free Trade Zone is made a spring board for the economic development of the state.
Insisting that the Ilaje Free Trade Zone is a priority for him, Jegede while speaking with newsmen in Akure on Friday on his plan  to improve on the  state’s  economy said  the potential in the Southern area which include the Olokola Free Trade Zone, Omotosho power plant, the Bitumen and the deep sea port will be utilised by his government.
According to him, creating industry  has been an issue that has been on for some time, adding that  the problem is not in establishing industries, but in its sustenance.
“ The big issue is in sustaining them and making them run. To build an industry is a very simple thing; it is easier than to build a school. Just build a warehouse, import machines, and then get people who are technical to start operating it but you need power, you need the raw materials, you need to sell at a competitive price before you can sustain the industry” he explained.
