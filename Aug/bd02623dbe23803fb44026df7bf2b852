Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State has described the threat by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to carry out a protest against against his government for allegedly abusing public service process as a blackmail.
Apparently reacting to the report credited to the Wabba-led NLC to carry out a protest march against the state and Nasarawa, Okorocha said that the allegation of the NLC was false as government has paid workers in the state up till July.
Okorocha who spoke through his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Sam Onwuemeodo said the latest move by the NLC was simply to blackmail his administration.
He claimed no workers were being owned salaries as the have been paid up till July and that even with the introduction of the back to land for agriculture policy in which civil servants are required to work from Monday to Wednesday and used Thursday and Friday for farming,Â  the salaries of the workers were not slashed as the government never tampered with any of their entitlements.
He challenged the NLC leadership to publish their claims.
