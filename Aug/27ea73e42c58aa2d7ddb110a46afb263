(By Tony Osauzo – BENIN) Former Sergeant-at-Arms of the Edo State House of Assembly, Mr. Greg Osagie, escaped death by the whiskers at the weekend when gunmen invaded his residence in Benin City. Osagie, who was said to have joined the All Progressives Congress (APC) three months ago, had his residence, located off Stadium Road, Benin, riddled with bullets shortly after he was said to have returned from a political party meeting at about 8:30pm. Osagie, who just returned from abroad few days ago, said: “When I was coming back at about 8:30pm from a political meeting, I saw a jeep (sport utility vehicle) packed close to my house. But, I thought it was visitors who came to see my neighbour. So, I drove into my compound. “I was just removing my shoes when they shot into my bed room, bullets were now raining everywhere in the compound. They were calling me but I had to run outside through the back and escaped through the fence. So, they decided to destroy everywhere with bullets. My political opponents wanted me to play a script to discredit APC, but I said no, and that is what I am suffering.
“I am even lucky that my family went on holidays; they would have been killed if they were around. I was lucky to escape and I am grateful to God,” he said. At the scene yesterday, policemen from Adeiyan Division were seen conducting investigation on the incident, just as sympathisers were around to sympathize with him. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Chris Ezike, has promised to speak on the issue after visiting the scene of the incident.
