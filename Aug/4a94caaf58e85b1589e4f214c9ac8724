(By Agaju Madugba – KATSINA) A former Majority Leader at the Katsina State House of Assembly, Hon. Sani Liti Yankwani, says Senator Abu Ibrahim (Katsina South Senatorial zone) has got a case to answer in regard to the controversial budget padding issue at the National Assembly. Speaking at a press conference in Katsina, Yankwani accused Ibrahim of “betraying the people of Funtua,” whom he represents. “We are lucky that President Muhammadu Buhari comes from our state and that we have a President whose desire is to bring about changes from the way things were corruptly conducted in the country. “Given the President’s position, we thought that representatives from Katsina State at the National Assembly would  wholeheartedly support him, but the conduct of our Senator Abu Ibrahim shows that he had joined the bandwagon of those bent on sabotaging and embarrassing the President. “We have it on good authority that Senator Abu Ibrahim is neck-deep in the budget padding scandal at the National Assembly and we therefore call for his arrest over the issue. “We also wish to reaffirm our earlier call on the Senator to explain how he utilised the money given to him for constituency projects, during his nine years as our representative at the National Assembly.”
