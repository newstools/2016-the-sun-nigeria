From Theresa Egba, Abuja IN its determination to im­prove the livelihood of its teem­ing population and the econ­omy of its rural communities, the Federal Government, said it would establish skill acquisition centres across the country. The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, disclosed this during his meeting with the management of Triton Aqua Africa Limited, led by its Chair­man, Ashvin Samtani, in his office. The Minister noted that with an anticipated increase in Nigeria’s population which he put at 500 million by 2050, there was need for govern­ments to engage the youth in agriculture by establishing skill acquisition centres in the vari­ous states. He said the Federal Govern­ment had already acquired 100 hectares of land at Gaobe in Kuje Area Council of the FCT, Abuja, for the establishment of the skill acquisition centre. According to the Minister, “the young people are not hap­py with us; we need to find jobs for them. The African economy is not doing very well, oil and gas will not employ a million workers at the best of time and we are heading for 500 million people in 34 years.
