Tinsel starlet, Aisha Shaba, has lamented how Nigerian men broke her tender heart several times.
But, according to the pretty actress, that hasn’t stopped her from believing in true love, as she is always ready to fall in love again.
Hear her: “Why not? My heart has been broken several times by Nigerian boys, but that shouldn’t stop one from loving again. We can’t help it sometimes. I love to love. I like smart guys, handsome, tall, and intelligent; and of course God fearing. My guy should love to read and also very ambitious.”
Aisha, who grew up predominantly in England and graduated with a degree in International Business and Finance in 2007, said she can never fight over a man no matter how much she loves him.
“No. Never! I can never fight over a man. I have no business with any lady my man decides to move on with. I believe moving to another relationship is the decision a guy makes and I have to respect him for that and just walk away. I have never fought over a man and never will.”
