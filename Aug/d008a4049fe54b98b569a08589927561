They would be sworn in officially later this month.
Meanwhile, Nigeria Lawyer, a law magazine reported that supporters of Gadzama and Mahmoud engaged in a war of words over allegations of plans to rig the elections.
Opening the can of worms, a key supporter of Gadzama, Mr. T. T. Hyundu wrote: “Gentlemen, it has been discovered that the NBA EXCO fraudulently created a portal for A. B. Mahmoud where the result was collated separately from the original portal.”
But the Mahmoud camp quickly fired back through Mr. Jibrin Sam Okutepa (SAN), who said: “Mr. Hyundu, I don’t think, giving (sic) your propensity to make wild and unsubstantiated allegations, I will be bothered about what you posted. But having invited me, and the fact that I am a stakeholder in this project of the Bar, I am forced to react thus: That your allegation of manipulation of voters register with over 200 members to favour one candidate against your preferred candidate must be proved by you, and you need to supply sufficient particulars.
