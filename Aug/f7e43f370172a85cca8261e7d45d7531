From Ighomuaye Lucky, Benin Labour Party (LP), at the weekend  flagged off its campaign with a promise to build homes to take care of old people in the state.
Addressing party faithful at Agbado Primary School in Benin City, the governorship candidate, Pastor Amos Osalumense Areloegbe said his government would take care of the aged and make life comfortable for all in the state.
The LP governorship hopeful, also promised economic growth, youth empowerment and agricultural development within two years, adding that he would be accountable to all, failing which he should be removed from office by the people.
“I want to tell you that if I cannot deliver on my promises to create empowerment programmes for the youth, agricultural development and make life meaningful for the people of the state after two years of my stay  in office  as the governor of the state, you people have the power to vote me out”, he said.
Also speaking, his  running mate, Jane Osagie said women would be given loans to set up businesses of their choice, while more attention would be channelled toward ensuring the safety and sustainability of the environment, which she observed has been one of the sectors  neglected by government.
