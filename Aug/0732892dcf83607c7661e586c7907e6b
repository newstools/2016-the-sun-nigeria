Dream Team defender, William Troost-Ekong will be available for selection for tonight’s clash.
It was thought the FK Haugesund skipper had to play through the pain barrier to help Nigeria record a win over Japan two days ago, having picked up a knock that required treatment during the game.
The good news from Manaus is that Troost-Ekong took part in full training with the national team on Friday evening without feeling any pain.
In fact, all the players named in the roster have been given a clean bill of health by team medics despite stepping out onto the Amazônia Arena turf less than seven hours after their arrival in Manaus.
Meanwhile, Osmanlıspor striker Umar Aminu is in line to make his first-ever appearance at the Olympic Games on Sunday night when the Dream Team face Sweden in a Group B clash.
The Super Eagles rising star was not involved in Nigeria’s 5-4 win over Japan on Friday morning because he had featured for his Turkish club in the Europa League the previous day.
“I am now in Brazil and I arrived last night, ”Aminu briefly told allnigeriasoccer.com when asked if he has kept his word of joining the Nigeria U23s on Friday.
All things being equal, the ex-Flying Eagles star will train with the team on Saturday before Samson Siasia makes a decision whether or not he’ll get game time against the Scandinavians.
