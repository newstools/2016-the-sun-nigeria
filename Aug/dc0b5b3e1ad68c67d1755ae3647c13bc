The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has expressed appreciation to the judiciary over the Appeal Court judgment that quashed the nullification of the election of the Abia State governor, Okezie Ikpeazu by the Federal High Court, Abuja, presided over by Justice Okon Abang.
The party in a statement issued yesterday evening by its spokesman, Prince Dayo Adeyeye, described the judgement of the appellate court as victory for the rule of law and democracy.
“What transpired at the Court of Appeal on Thursday, August 18, 2016, has once again rekindled our trust in the judiciary as the last hope of the common man”, the PDP said.
It called on the Nigeria Judicial Council (NJC) in particular, to continue to live up to its responsibility of maintaining an unbiased judiciary that will be neutral on all issues brought before it.
