(Taiwo Amodu, ABUJA) In a move to halt the national convention of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) the chairman of its dissolved national working committee, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff has written to the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) not to observe the convention slated for August 17 in Port Harcourt. The former Borno state governor in a letter dated August 2, 2016 and addressed to INEC chairman, Professor Mahmoud Yaquub, Senator Sheriff declared that the Makarfi-led Caretaker Committee, a creation of the national convention of the main opposition party was illegal and has no powers under the PDP constitution to convene the partyâ€™s National Convention. Claiming ignorance of the scheduled convention, Sheriff said the electoral body and the general public should note that the PDP under his leadership was not planning any National Convention as he has not been so authorized by the National Executive Committee. He further claimed that any convention organised by the Senator Makarfi committee would be in direct contempt of valid Court Orders which has accorded him recognition.
