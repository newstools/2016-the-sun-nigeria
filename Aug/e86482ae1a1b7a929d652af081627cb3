By Judith Nwabia Golden Eaglets yesterday left Abuja for Sokoto to train and acclimatize ahead of their U17 AFCON qualifier return leg against Niger on Saturday.
After grabbing a 1-0 win in the first leg in Abuja, the Eaglets will leave no stone unturned to ensure Niger doesn’t overturn their loss  when both sides lock horns in Niamey and so had gone to camp in Sokoto in Nigeria which has a similar climate condition with where the return leg would be played.
The Niger coach predicted a 3-0 home win by his team against the five-time world champions.
Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Head of Psychology, Dr. Robinson Okosun had earlier  warned the players to be ready for the task ahead after they were forced to a 1-1 draw in a tune up match on Saturday by Clique Sports Football Academy of Lagos at the NFF\FIFA Goal Project Pitch in Abuja
