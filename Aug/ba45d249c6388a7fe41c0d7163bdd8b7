As Nigerian workers held a national day of mourning and protest against ill treatment of workers nationwide today, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), has charged the Federal Government to call the erring governors to order.
Organised Labour specifically mandated President Muhammadu Buhari and Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige to immediately prevail on the governors of Benue, Imo and Nassarawa states to respect Nigeria labour law, stop wage cut and arbitrary redeployment of workers to the farms as a way of avoiding full pay.
Leading the workers in Lagos, in ‎the protest against the recent killing of two workers in Nassarawa State by Government House security operatives as well as the increasing violations of workers’ rights in the country, Issa Aremu, a National Executive Council member of the NLC and Chairman of IndustriALL Global Union, Sub Saharan Africa, said that the protest and strike in Nassarawa would continue until the perpetrators of the heinous crime was brought to book.
