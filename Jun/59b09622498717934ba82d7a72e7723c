The third edition of the inspirational women empowerment conference, Flourish Africa, founded by Nigerian oil mogul and Executive Vice Chairman of Famfa Oil, Mrs. Folorunso Alakija, is set to take place in Lagos on July 20th 2019. The theme for this year is “The Motion to Disrupt” and has called on a line up of disruptive women to share their experiences with a room of 1000 millennials. Flourish Africa has a mandate to equip young women with the tools they need to become who God has destined them to become through mentoring programs, skills acquisition sessions and events that focus on the well-being of the millennial woman. In addition, the platform has an online blog which provides valuable information to help address the various challenges women go through on a daily basis. This year, Peace Hyde, who is the founder of education non-profit Aim Higher Africa, an organization that empowered over 6000 grassroots entrepreneurs to start businesses that transform and empower impoverished communities, is confirmed to deliver the keynote address.
