From Abdullah Tsoho, Dutse FORMER Jigawa State gov­ernor, Alhaji Sule Lamido has reacted to the state­ment made by the National Chairman of the All Pro­gressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie -Oyegun, that if the present econom­ic meltdown in the nation was caused by the sins of the Peoples Democratic Peoples (PDP), then APC is a coalition of sinners be­cause the party was formed by PDP members. Lamido reacted yesterday while fielding questions from newsmen in his vil­lage, Bamaina, Jigawa State. He explained that the APC got a chance and won the 2015 general election with support of PDP mem­bers, who defected to APC few months before election. According to him, most of them were those who served as governors, minis­ters and even as vice presi­dents for many years under PDP. Lamido maintained that if PDP committed sins dur­ing its 16 years in power, with people like Kwank­waso, Wammako, Amaechi, Tambuwal, Ganduje, Atiku and many others produced and born by PDP who are claiming the ruling party to­day, that makes APC a coali­tion of sinners. His words: “If the present economic meltdown and hardship is caused by PDP, then APC was born by great sinners and without PDP sinners, APC would not have taken power during the last gen­eral election.” Lamido faulted the rul­ing party, accusing it of achieving nothing within their one year in office. He said APC was rather making mistakes that have plunged the nation into its present economic hard­ship. Speaking on the insecu­rity bedeviling the nation and Niger Delta region in particular, Lamido related the crisis to social injustice among Nigerians and the leadership in particular.
