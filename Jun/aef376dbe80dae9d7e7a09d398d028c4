EMINENT business mogul and former governor of Abia State, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, has called on Muslims to use the holy month of Ramadan to rededicate themselves to the teachings of the holy Quran by demonstrating the exem­plary qualities of Prophet Mohammed in their daily lives. According to the former governor, Muslims and non- Muslims alike must imbibe the spirit of love, alms giving, selflessness and togetherness in order to sustain peaceful co-existence and unity regardless of religious, ethnic, so­cial and economic differences. In a goodwill message signed by his Special Adviser, Al­haji Kunle Oyewumi, Kalu said, “as Muslims all over the world commence the compulsory Ramadan, I wish to ad­monish the Muslim community to make the best use of the holy month of Ramadan in achieving spiritual cleans­ing and fulfilment. “It is a special season of divine uplift and sober reflec­tion. It is important to offer special prayers for the prog­ress of the nation while providing for the less privileged in the society during Ramadan. It is my prayer that Almighty Allah will accept our supplications in this holy month”. Kalu seized the opportunity to task leaders at all levels of government to live up to expectation by making the people’s welfare a priority in their policy thrust and added that, despite the financial challenges facing the nation, workers’ salaries and pensions must be paid when due to avoid system collapse. The former governor urged spiritual leaders to further sensitise the people to the negative consequences of vio­lence and wished the Muslim Ummah a spiritually-fulfill­ing month of Ramadan with its attendant blessings. He added that Nigerians should support efforts of the Presi­dent Muhammadu Buhari-led administration in building a prosperous Nigeria.
