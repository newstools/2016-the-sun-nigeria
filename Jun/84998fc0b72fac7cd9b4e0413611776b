By Christopher Oji In line with its corporate social responsibility, First City Monument Bank (FCMB) has sponsored 400 Nigerians in eyes surgeries across the country. The bank said over 400 hundred Nigerians who suffered one eye problem or the other, especially cataract, benefited from the gesture nationwide. The eye treatment was done between May 9 and 29 in Calabar, Cross River State, for patients in the South and Kebbi, Kebbi State, for those in the North.
Group Head, Corporate Affairs, FCMB, Mr. Diran Olojo, said, this year’s project themed, ‘Priceless of Sight’, is a social service initiative our bank has sponsored for seven years in a row. It is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aspect of health for all campaign.
“It also fundamentally aligns with our corporate social responsibility to give back to the communities where we do business. The bank is not just to make profit but is also concerned with the need to positively affect and impact the community. We contribute towards national development.”
“We partnered with professionals from India who gave out their best. All the patients who have benefited from the programme attested to the quality of services given to them. Those who benefited from the medical examinations, surgeries and free eye glasses included indigent Nigerians, less privileged and senior citizens without any condition attached to the gesture.”
On his own, Chief Operating Officer, Tulsi Chanrai Foundation (TCF), Mr. Col Prasad, thanked FCMB for its generosity in sponsoring 400 patients for eye surgeries this year despite the economic hardship in the country.
