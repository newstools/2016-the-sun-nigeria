The Niger Delta Avengers (NDA), the militant group which has claimed responsibility for most of the attacks on oil installations, says it has blown up a Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) oil facility. The Forcados pipeline, which transports 250,000 barrels per day, was first bombed in February and had just undergone repairs. The militants also said it had hit the Brass to Tebidaba crude pipeline in the latest attacks to bring oil production and export to zero. The militants made these claims on Twitter early Friday morning. They tweeted: “At 3am today, NDAvengers blew up the SPDC forcados 48’ exportline.” “We warned SPDC not to go ahead with repair works but they refused.”
On Thursday, they also claimed that they had blown up pipelines in Bayelsa state. Nigeria’s 2016 budget is benchmarked at $38 oil price and production quantity of 2.2 million barrels per day. Although oil price has risen to nearly $50, production has gone down to as low as 1.4 million barrels per day, leading to a shortfall. The budget already had a $2 billion deficit before the Niger Delta crisis.
