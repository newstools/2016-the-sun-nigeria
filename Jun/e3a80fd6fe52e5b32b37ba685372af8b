The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu has announced the end of Post-UTME (Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination) and pegged tertiary admission cut-off at 180. Speaking at the 2016 policy meeting of the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), the minister said tertiary institutions were free to screen applicants, but warned against subjecting them to a second examination process. He said: “JAMB is one of the most active parastatals in the ministry; I expect that policies that would be beneficial to Nigerian students should be discussed at this meeting,” he said. “As far as I am concerned, the nation has confidence in what JAMB is doing. The universities should not be holding another examination. “If the universities have any complain against JAMB, let them bring it and then we address it. “I believe there should be no ground to lower the quality; November. 30 remains the closing date for 2016 admission. No institution should exceed its quota in admission; we will start issuing penalties to defaulting institutions.” At the meeting, Dibu Ojerinde, a professor and the JAMB registrar, announced 180 as the minimum cut off mark for tertiary institutions in country. “One-hundred-and-eighty is given and no institution will go below 180 this year; some universities can go above it, I know Obafemi Awolowo University of Ife, will not go below 200 and University of Lagos will not go below 200, and also University of Ibadan. All these ones stand. But 180 is a bench mark for others.” Ojerinde said the re-distribution process for candidates is already ongoing as it was embedded in the registration procedure. “We will get enough candidates to take in all the schools if they are serious,” he said.
