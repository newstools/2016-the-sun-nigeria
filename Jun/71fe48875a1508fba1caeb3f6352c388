Former military head of state, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, on Wednesday debunked reports that he had passed on. Babangida, who called into the Journalists’ Hangout programme on Television Continental (TVC) monitored in Lagos, said he was responding to treatment.
Speaking from Germany, he said he would return to Nigeria “anytime soon.”
His eldest son, Mohammed, had called into the programme a few minutes earlier, saying rumours about his father’s death were unfounded.
Mohammed, who said he was speaking from Minna, Niger State, said his father would return to Nigeria by weekend.
