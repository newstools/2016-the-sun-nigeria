By Adetutu Folasade-Koyi NIGERIA’S former mili­tary president, General Ibrahim Badamasi Baban­gida (retd), spoke from Germany, yesterday, where he has been in the last few weeks. IBB, as he is fondly called, declared he is alive, contrary to reports that he had died on Tuesday. He spoke on a Television Con­tinental (TVC) programme yesterday and disclosed he will soon return home. He told TVC crew: “I am alive.” Regardless, newsmen continued to lay siege to his Minna Hill-Top home. Reports indicated every­thing seemed normal as the road and barricade leading to his home were manned by the same security men who have been guarding the house. Newsmen were not allowed to go close to the house as security men also warned against taking photographs. There were no unusual movements of person­alities, family members or visitation from any quarter as people and vehicles re­portedly went about their normal businesses. A family source told newsmen: “We are expect­ing General this week.” Earlier information in­dicated that Babangida was due to return on Tues­day but did not. Another source, who declined to be named, further disclosed that the death rumour is false. “Nigerians should keep praying for him. If IBB were to be dead since last week as rumoured, by now, which is over three days, wouldn’t he have been brought back and be buried according to Islamic rites?” Babangida’s family have also refused to speak on the matter.
