(LAGOS) A federal lawmaker in northeast Nigeria’s Adamawa State has raised concerns over recent Boko Haram attacks in his constituency. Adamu Kamale, representing Michika/Madagali Federal Constituency, told reporters in Yola, capital of Adamawa on Sunday that the insurgents are still attacking border villages in the area. Kamale claimed that last week the insurgents attacked Waga village in Madagali area where they killed two vigilante and abducted three women. “I spent five days in my constituency where people are still living in fear. Last week, they killed two vigilantes in Waga , and hours later they proceeded to nearby villages during which three women were abducted,” Kamale said. He called for more military presence in his constituency, adding that he had reported the situation to the military authorities in Abuja, Nigerian capital city. Last year, Nigerian troops recaptured Michika town and its environs in northeastern Adamawa from Boko Haram insurgents. The insurrection by Boko Haram, which wants to create an Islamic state in mainly Muslim northern Nigeria, has claimed more than 10,000 lives in the past five years. (Source: XINHUA)
