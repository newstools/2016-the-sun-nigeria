(Petrus Obi, ENUGU) Eleven persons have been arrested in Enugu for allegedly involving in the illegal broadcast of Multichoice signals as well as the use of MP3 to pirate musical work of artistes for commercial purposes. Equipment worth millions of naira were also confiscated during the raid which marked the beginning of the clamp down on the commercial use of MP3 to download works from the Internet. Director of Enforcement for the Nigeria Copyright Commission (NCC), Mr. Augustine Amodu, who briefed newsmen said the commission decided to address the issue of MP3 based on persistent complain. He described MP3 as a device used to download musical works, “it is piracy when it is used to make money and the NCC is ready to see that issues of this nature are checked for a change.” He noted that downloading such musical works into MP3 for commercial purposes is piracy and urged those involved in such acts to desist from it as the commission was out to enforce compliance. Also arrested were those who specialize in re-transmitting DSTV signals to a large audience who in turn pay a token for the services. Ahmodu noted that the Nigeria Copyright Commission is ready to ensure that the issue of MP3 is nipped in the bud expressing regrets that artistes are suffering because of such sharp practices. He described MP3 as a device that has come into the country to destroy works of arts, of music. We should stand and fight this menace. “We have done surveillance on where these MP3 pirates exist and we are ready to make sure we clamp them down because people who have genuine rights are not benefiting from their sweat but hoodlums are already millionaires from this very wicked act.” He implored Nigerians to assist the Commission in ensuring that those who perpetrate the act are brought to book Poiting out that the Director General of NCC Afam Ezekude does not tolerate the idea of infringement on copyright matters at all.
