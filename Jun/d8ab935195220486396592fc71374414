ATTORNEY General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Jus­tice, Alhaji Abubakar Malami, has asked the Economic and Finan­cial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to furnish his of­fice with the case file of Nze Chidi Duru, on the case of First Guarantee Pensions Limited. The EFCC insti­tuted a case against Nze Duru in charge no ID/20139C/2015 at the High Court of Lagos State. The AGF’s letter is se­quel to a petition from Duru over EFCC harass­ment and prosecution on a matter that had been decided in his fa­vour by two courts. In reaction to Duru’s petition, the AGF, in a letter entitled: Re-malicious persecution, signed by Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) of the Federation, Mohammed Saidu Diri on behalf of the justice minister, requested the EFCC to forward the case file to his office to enable the AGF review the case and take an in­formed decision. Part of the letter reads: “You may wish to refer to the above subject matter and be informed that the Hon­ourable Attorney Gen­eral of the Federation is in receipt of a petition from the law firm of U and A Attorneys on be­half of their client, Nze Chidi Duru who is being prosecuted by your com­mission.” Nze Duru, who is founder and promoter of First Guarantee Pen­sions Limited, has been having a running battle with the Nigerian Pen­sions Commission over the takeover of his com­pany without following due process. Following a ‘target re­port’, Pencom had dis­solved the board and management of First Guarantee Pensions Limited, without follow­ing the provisions of the Pensions Reforms Act. Duru went to court to challenge this and got favorable judgment. The court ruled that the board and manage­ment should be reinstat­ed, but, Pencom has not complied. The EFCC suddenly came into the matter and, instead, charged him to court
