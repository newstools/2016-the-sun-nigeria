The Promotion of players like Kelechi Iheanacho and Musa Mu­hammed to the Super Eagles, both winners of the U-17 world Cup in the UAE in 2013 was an indication that more grease to the machinery that works the gears of Nigeria’s re­nowned U-17 scouting system can impact the senior teams in the near future.
