From Juliana Taiwo- Obalonye, Abuja Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has described as shocking, the death of the technical director of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and former coach of the Super Eagles, Amodu Shuaibu. He described the late Shuaibu as a dedicated public servant who worked tirelessly to bring honour to the nation. Osinbajo noted that Shuaibu’s death was coming just four days after the death of former player and Super Egles coach, Stephen Keshi. He recalled how the coach led the national team to two World Cup tournaments and answered the call to serve as national coach on a number of occasions. “In deed, his life was dedicated to finding and grooming some of Nigeria’s best soccer talents and providing them the leadership and guidance that enabled them to excel. “Amodu Shuaibu’s work as national coach of Nigeria’s national team brought gladness to the nation and fulfillment to many. His legacy is secured in the memories of Nigerians who will forever recall the exploits his teams recorded across the African continent and around the world…”
