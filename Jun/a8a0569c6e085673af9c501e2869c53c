Richard said that Tombra hails from Odimodi, Burutu Local Government Area of Delta State.
“I feel sad. I am weighed down. To me, I don’t know what Niger Delta Avengers want. They said they are fighting with the Federal government because they don’t want them to rest. But I see no reason why they should attack houseboat and killed civilians.
“I will appeal that the Federal Government should approach this issue with caution, so that we do not continue to lose our loved ones. The creeks are filled with soldiers. We can’t move freely again and there is nowhere to go,” he said.
