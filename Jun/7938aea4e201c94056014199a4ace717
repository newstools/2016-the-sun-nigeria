(Mark Pippah) Four days after the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State conducted its primaries in preparation for the September 10 governorship election, some women of the ruling APC in the state has rejected the result of the party’s primary which was conducted last Saturday, June 18, 2016 at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium. The Edo State APC women led by the Executive Director, Poverty Alleviation and Women Mobilization to Edo State Governor, Mrs. Evelyn Igbafe today made the call for the cancellation of the recently conducted primaries. The women who said the news briefing jointly addressed by two of the party’s governorship aspirants, Engineer Chris Ogiemwonyi and Barrister Kenneth Imansuangbon has opened their eyes to the alleged irregularities that took place at the primary. Recall that on Monday, June 20, 2016, during a joint press briefing at the Ogiemwonyi campaign headquarters in Benin, the duo (Engr. Chris Ogiemwonyi and Barr. Kenneth Imansuangbon) had rejected the results of the party’s June 18 primary and the eventual winner, Mr. Godwin Obaseki. At the joint press briefing, the aspirants alleged that the ballot papers used for the voting were electronically manipulated to favour Mr. Obaseki. The aspirants who appealed to the appeal panel set up by the National headquarters of the party to order a repeat and resorting of the ballots also accused Governor Adams Oshiomhole of physically intimidating delegates to vote for Mr. Obaseki.
