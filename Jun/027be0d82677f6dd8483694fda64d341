From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja the Federal Government has inaugurated a 16-man ministerial implementation committee to roll-out modalities for building an Inland Dry Port in Kaduna.
Minister of Transportation, Ameachi, who inaugurated the committee in Abuja yesterday, charged the committee to develop a workable roadmap for effective release and smooth flow of dry ports bound containers/cargoes to and from the country’s seaports.
Members include Hassan Bello, Ekawu PO, Makinde AN, Onojedo G, Ogbonnah MC, Nasir A Mohammed, Akin Osinowo, HI Swaomen, Todd Rives, Pastor SO Keshiro, Atiku Ahmed, Chiaka Nwaogu, Auta, Dr Eugene Nweke and MN Osonweke as secretary.
“Following the need to check the ripple effects of congestions in the nation’s seaports, the Federal Executive Council in March 2006 approved the establishment of Inland Container Deports (ICDs) in the country,” Amaechi said.
He added that the committee is expected to submit its report within six months from date of inauguration. At the end of the assignment, there would be the need to convert this committee into a ministerial standing committee to supervise and ensure full implementation of the ICD projects across the country.
