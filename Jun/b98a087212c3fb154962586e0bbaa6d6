By Uche Usim The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has completely disowned a trending online job portal, warning desperate jobseekers to disregard it.
The Service also says 12 culprits who are the masterminds of the online scam have also been arrested and will soon be arraigned.
The Spokesman of NCS, Wale Adeniyi who made this known on Monday in a statement assured that the paramilitary body was launching an all-out war against internet fraudsters who specialise in fleecing innocent Nigerians in the pretext of offering them unavailable jobs, auctions or contracts.
“This integrated approach on social media, is coming on the heels of
recent upsurge of fraudsters using the name of the Nigeria Customs
Service to solicit applications for non-existent job offers for a fee
that is usually paid into personal bank accounts. The advert currently circulating on the WhatsApp platform is the latest of those criminal attempts to mislead desperate job-seekers.
“The post which went viral over the weekend is a copy and paste
reproduction of the previous recruitment adverts, with a clever
insertion of the Service website address. To achieve their criminal
objective, the same advert directs applicants to visit a fake website
which is www.customsrecruit.com.ng. Victims are eventually requested
to make some payments to complete the phoney forms”, Adeniyi explained.
The Customs Spokesman however, advised the public to discountenance such advertisements found in any online platforms except those released in the NCS authentic and authoritative platforms such as www.customs.gov.ng and www.facebook.com/customsng.
“To avoid being victims, all prospective job seekers, and those who
want to transact any business with the Service are advised to note the
official online platforms as well as visit the nearest Customs station when in doubt”, he added.
