From Paul Osuyi, Asaba GOVERNOR Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has once again restated the resolve of his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to win the forthcoming governorship election in Edo State. Okowa said he would be involved in the campaign to root the APC out from the Government House in Benin and usher in a progressive and development-oriented government led by the PDP. The governor made this known in a congratulatory message to Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu who emerged as the governorship candidate of the PDP during the party’s primary election conducted at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin City on Saturday. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Charles Aniagwu, Okowa described the emergence of Ize-Iyamu who is a former Secretary to the Edo State Government as “well deserved.” The governor praised the resilience of the PDP candidate who polled 584 votes to beat his closest rival, Hon. Mathew Iduoriyekemwen who got 91 votes, while Dr. Solomon Edebiri scored 38 votes. He hailed the Electoral Panel for the peaceful conduct of the election while assuring the people of Edo State that as members of one family, he would help to prosecute the final campaigns leading to the election. According to him: “I thank God that I witnessed this election, the organizers of the primaries promised free and fair elections; I am so glad because a candidate has emerged through a very acceptable process and it will make the work easier.”
