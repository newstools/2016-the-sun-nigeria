From Tony Osauzo, Benin The Edo State Police Command has arrested two suspected notorious kidnappers who operated across several states.
The suspects, Ogedengbe and Momoh, were arrested after a vehicle of a kidnapped victim seized in Owerri, Imo State was sold at Ewu, in Edo State for N1.6 milion
The Police said it was during an attempt by the buyer to register the vehicle that officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) discovered that the vehicle had earlier been registered.
According to the Acting Public Relations Officer (APRO) of the command, SP Stephen Onwochei, who paraded the suspects yesterday, the husband of the kidnap victim, died due to cardiac arrest.
He said the kidnappers released the victim after collecting ransom and brought the vehicle to Benin for sale, adding that Ogedengbe was arrested last year over a car snatched in Kaduna State and was charged to court.
“I had earlier granted a Press interview last year over a vehicle, a Toyota Avensis, that was snatched in Kaduna when Ogedengbe was arrested.”
“In that previous offence, he was charged to court and granted bail. The matter is still on and he has not desisted from the crime”, Onwochei said.
Ogedengbe said he only signed as a witness for the seller, but his accomplice said it was Ogedengbe that brought the car to them for sale.
