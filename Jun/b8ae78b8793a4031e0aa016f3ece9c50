FROM EMMANUEL OGOIGBE, WARRI GENERAL Superintendent Deep­er Life Bible Church, Pastor Wil­liam Kumuyi has predicted brighter future for the country, saying Nige­ria will not disintegrate rather the nation will remain strongly united. According to him, the current hardship the nation faces is a pro­cess, adding, that there will be light at the end of the tunnel. Pastor Kumuyi who was fielding questions from newsmen during his one-day visit to Warri, said Nigeria is a great nation stressing that we should always pray for the progress of the country. On militancy, in the Nigeria Delta creeks, the church overseer urged Nigerians to pray fervently for peace to reign, and pleaded with the militants to embrace peace and dialogue. On restructuring of Nigeria, Ku­muyi noted that the issue should not bother anybody as it is not meant to break up the country, saying, “we should not worry ourselves too much on the issue. We should rath­er think on how we can move the country forward because too much talk about restructuring does not mean Nigeria will break up”. Pastor Kumuyi, whose mes­sage of the one-day crusade titled, “Following a life transforming ex­ample”, stated that he was in Warri to change lives and pray for perma­nent peace in the oil city and envi­rons. “Let us not create an impres­sion that Nigeria is totally down, we should rather seek solution on how the country can be greater”, re­marked the pastor, insisting that Ni­gerians should go down in prayers. During prayer sessions at the stadium, a lot of persons including those afflicted were healed.
