Lafarge shareholders approve over 496m shares as bonus …To get N3 dividend By Omodele Adigun The shareholders of Lafarge Africa Plc, Monday, in Lagos unanimously approved about 497 million shares proposed by the company’s board as bonus, just as they  would take home N3 per share as dividend.
As part of the special business at the 57th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the company, the shareholders passed a resolution that, following the recommendation of the directors, the sum of N248,403,876, out of the total of N186,419,988,000 credited to the share premium of the account, be capitalised as 496,807,752 ordinary shares by way of bonus shares in the ratio of one new share for every 10 shares held.
In the same breath, the investors also  gave their nod to the N3 per share dividend proposed by the directors for the shareholders in Nigeria.
Speaking at the occasion, the Group Managing Director/CEO of the company, Mr. Michel Puchercos, stated that overall, new strategies in penetrating retail, new geographies and the technical segment are expected to push Lafarge Africa’s volumes to grow above a flat market in all three product lines.
He added: “The Nigerian operations of Lafarge Africa, having been successfully unified and rationalised under one management team, is cognizant of the different stakeholders’ expectations and promise to drive efficiencies that will ultimately generate remarkable synergy savings for overall improved performance.
In his remarks, the Chairman of the company, Mr. Mobolaji Balogun, noted that 2015 was transformational and the first full operational year of the new enlarged company.
He stated: “We have now built a significant platform to drive value creation for all stakeholders and in particular, our shareholders.”
Commenting on the companys outlook, Balogun foresaw growth opportunities in 2016 and beyond for the building material sector. ìThe 2016 Federal Government budget indicates a significant increase in the spending on infrastructure and capital projects. The Government recognizes the urgent need to re-invest in Nigerian infrastructure to catalyze much needed growth. With the on-going 2.5mt expansion project in Calabar, which is expected to be commissioned before year end, and plans for Ashaka, our cement production capacity in Nigeria is on the increaseî he stated.
The Chairman reported that the company continued to build on the successful completion of the Lafarge Africa asset consolidation through some strategic initiatives, including increasing its shareholding in Ashakacem to 82.46 per cent via a Mandatory Tender Offer and acquisition of further stake in Unicem. He enjoined the shareholders to support the on-going Ashakacem Voluntary Tender Offer which according to him, provides opportunity for the minorities to participate in a much larger growth platform, which Lafarge Africa represents.
In simple terms, the offer creates the immediate and direct advantage of moving from investors in AshakaCem with one million metric tones per annum (mtpa) cement production capacity to Lafarge Africa with 12mtpa and an additional 2.5mtpa due for commissioning by the end of 2016. The consideration offered for the tender is quite favourable to shareholders of AshakaCem,î he explained.
