From Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa ACADEMIC Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) of the Niger Delta University (NDU), Wilberforce Island, Bay­elsa State is mulling a position on government’s offer to pay one-month salary or call off the strike it declared over unpaid salaries. The institution has­been shut down and stu­dents sent home for three months since lecturers decided to embark on the industrial action to press home demand for five months salary arrears. Governor Seriake Dick­son, in his efforts to re­solve the face-off with members of ASUU in a meeting with the leader­ship of the union, offered to pay January salary to the lecturers and other staff of the institution. In the meeting, Dick­son also said pending the outcome of a congress meeting of ASUU to de­termine an acceptable mode of payment of the salaries, he also approved the payment of 50 per cent of salaries to all staff of the university. According to him, the approval was part of the decisions reached be­tween the state govern­ment and the leadership of ASUU, NDU branch, at a meeting in Government House. Already, workers un­der the aegis of the Se­nior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities, National Association of Academic Technologists, and the Non-Academic Staff of Universities have vowed not to return to classes until four months out of their six months salaries are paid. Chairman of ASUU in the institution, Dr. Stan­ley Ogoun, in an inter­view, said congress would wait for the state govern­ment to fulfil its promise of paying the one month salary before the congress would take a decision. “The decision to call off the strike is left for the congress to decide. The government has promised to pay one month and ASUU mem­bers want to see the com­mitment of the payment before a decision would be taken; the leadership of ASUU cannot take a decision, only congress can do that,” he said.
