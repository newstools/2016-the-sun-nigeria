(Magnus Eze, ABUJA) The General Superintendent (GS) of Deeper Life Bible Church, Pastor William Kumuyi, is optimistic that things would soon turnaround for good in Nigeria. Kumuyi stated this while speaking to newsmen as he arrived the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, at the weekend for a crusade tagged ‘Night of Extraordinary Wonders’ organised by the Deeper Life Bible Church at the National Stadium, Abuja yesterday. He said: “I do not think we (Nigerians) should lose hope; there is God in heaven who answers prayers, there is Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour who wants the best for everyone of us; and there are some of us who are praying and we believe that God answers prayers and so we are not going to lose hope in our country. Things are going to turn around.” The cleric assured people in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, about God’s mighty visitation and touch upon their lives during the one-day crusade. “It will bring blessings to the people of the Federal Capital Territory and the country at large”, he stated.
The man of God said that there was need for dialogue that would bring the various groups in the country; their demands and expectations to the the table instead of throwing ‘stones’ at one another. On the call for the country to be restructured, Kumuyi said restructuring should not be such that will break the country into fragments where visas will be required for citizens to enter the various geopolitical zones but as a way to strengthen the unity of the country. He therefore recommended due consultations via referendum or panel to peacefully resolve crisis and to keep the nation as an entity. Regarding Anchor University, the Church proposes to establish, Kumuyi said the Church has been on it and also officials of the Nigerian Universities Commission (NUC) had visited the proposed campus for inspection for eventual take-off of the institution.
