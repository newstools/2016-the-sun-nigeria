From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja INDICATIONS emerged yesterday that the Nation­al Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progres­sives Congress (APC) has appointed Governor of Katsina State Aminu Bello Masari to chair the com­mittee that will conduct primaries for the Edo State governorship election billed for Friday June 17. Although a member of the NWC refused to con­firm the speculation, Ma­sari’s presence at the APC national headquarters in Abuja, where he consulted with the National Chair­man, Chief John Odigie- Oyegun, for several hours and the National Organis­ing Committee, yesterday, gave enough indication that he would chair the committee. The former Speaker of the House of Representa­tives refused to speak with newsmen who waited sev­eral hours to confirm his mission at the secretariat. He promised to address the media today, which coincides with the inaugu­ration of the committee to conduct the election. Appointment of Masari will be in line with the tra­dition of the ruling party using sitting governors to oversee state primaries with Kaduna State Gover­nor, Nasir El-Rufai going to Kogi State and Adams Oshiomhole to Bayelsa State. A reliable source at the secretariat told Daily Sun that the choice of Masari is in line with the deter­mination of the party’s na­tional leadership to ensure that a free, fair and cred­ible primary is conducted, following allegations that Oshiomhole had anointed a particular candidate. “What other confirma­tion do you need with his presence at the secretariat today and the wide con­sultations he made with almost the national lead­ership of the party? The committee to conduct the primary will be inaugu­rated today ahead of the primary this weekend and he has promised to talk to the media, probably after the inauguration. “Don’t also forget that the na­tional leadership needs a credible person to con­duct the primary, due to allegations from other as­pirants, about the gover­nor anointing and favour­ing a candidate,” another source added.
