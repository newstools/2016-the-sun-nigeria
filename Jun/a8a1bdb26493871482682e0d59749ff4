Following the controversy surrounding Federal Government’s bid to create grazing reserves for cattle herders in states of the Federation, the Minister of Agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbeh yesterday wondered why people act “as if they do not eat meat?” He, however, told journalists at the Palace of the Lamido Adamawa during a working visit to Adamawa state that the Federal Government has resolved to shelve the issue of grazing fields and has opted for ranches. He stressed that those states that do not want grazing zones will not be forced. The Minister was quick to ask, “why do people do this as if they do not eat meat?” “The business of government is to find equitable solution to the problem as such the government will not force any state to provide grazing land”, he declared Ogbeh maintained the only way to go is to develop ranches, insisting that nobody was supposed to carry weapon or kill anybody. Wondering why a country with 45 million hectres of land cannot accommodate 20 million cows, he advised Nigerians not to see religion and ethnicity in every aspect of life. (Source: DAILY POST)
