Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode has eased out the Head of Service (HoS), Mrs. Olabowale Ademola, who is enmeshed in an alleged bribery scandal with her husband, Justice Adeniji Ademola of the Federal High Court. Ambode has appointed Mrs Folashade Sidikatu Adesoye as acting HoS. It was gathered that the decision was taken because “the image of the Lagos State Government is being smeared by the arraignment of Ademola, with her husband in court, by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over allegations of corrupt practices.” An Abuja High Court on Tuesday granted Justice Ademola and Olabowale bail in the sum of N50 million each and adjourned trial to January 18. They were arraigned by on an 11-count charge of criminal conspiracy to receive gratification in various ways, contrary to Section 8(1)(a) of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Act, 2000. Justice Ademola was among the seven justices under the searchlight of the Department of State Services (DSS) over alleged graft. The DSS stormed his house in a sting operationcarried out on October 8 and 9, 2016. The acting HoS, Adesoye was, until her appointment, the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation.
