 Former Falcons coach, Izilien cries out over unpaid bonuses By George Aluo Former Super Falcons coach, Godwin Izilien has declared that the present squad of the team are not the only ones waiting to be settled by the nation’s soccer governing body, NFF.
Izilien who in 2004 led the team to victory in South Africa said twelve years after achieving the feat, the NFF is still owing him his winning bonuses and allowances running into millions of naira.
Izilien who spoke exclusively to Sunday Sunsports from his base in Benin said all efforts he has made to get his money from the Glass House has proved abortive. He said he is not surprised that Omagbemi and her wards are also battling NFF over bonuses.
“My brother, this none payment stuff didn’t start today. You will recall that this was the same embarrassment we faced in South Africa when we won this same cup in 2004. The girls refused to board the plane home until they get paid. I had to plead with them to do a rethink. We returned home after four days of protest in South Africa. Today as we speak, I have not been paid by the NFF. In fact, somebody in the Glass House told me my file is missing. I m still pressing for my pay. I worked hard to bring honor to this country only to be denied my statutory entitlement. I m appealing to the NFF to please pay me now,” Izilien said.
The coach said those running the game in the country should put the welfare of the players and coaches first, even as he urged the government to invest more in sports.
“Sports is one thing that unites the country. Our athletes have been doing the country proud from football to boxing, athletics name it. It’s unfortunate that in spite of all these, athletes and their handlers are not adequately catered for. Our administrators must learn to make the welfare of athletes a priority.”
