By Bimbola Oyesola Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has averted closure of another textile company, Nichemtex, which would have led to the sack of over 3,000 workers.
The company, which has threatened closure and sack of its workforce due to over billing from the Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company was reported to have paid over N400 million on power generation within one month.
However, the workers protest at the MAN House in Ikeja, Lagos, from 9 a.m to 11 a.m had prompted the manufacturers’ body to find solution to the electricity problem, which began over three months ago.
The workers had accused MAN of being responsible for the plight of their company through omitting the name of the firm in the list of the members sent to the distribution company.
According to the workers’ representative, Umar Abdul Azeez, MAN members, due to a court judgement, enjoyed a rebate on MYTO 2.0, while non-members paid 2.1, a higher payment.
“Though our company is not owing, but because we are not on the MAN list, the distribution company had disconnected us on November 17 and since then we have been on diesel, but our management said they could no longer do this and threatening to close down. So we have to take our destiny in our hands,” he said.
The MAN Corporate Affairs Manager, Olusegun Osidipe, however, denied the allegation that the company was delisted from the association list.
He explained that there was never a time the company was delisted, but it would have been impossible to list all the members in the list upon which judgement was granted. He, however, said the case has been resolved with the electricity company.
“We followed them to the electricity company to resolve the issue and so far, we’ve got to a very appreciable length as the company has promised to restore power to the company,” he said.
