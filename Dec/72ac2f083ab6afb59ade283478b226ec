From: GODWIN TSA, Abuja  The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission(EFCC), yesterday withdrew the five-count charge brought against former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Senator Bala Mohammed. The charges marked CR/43/2016 were earlier  filed before the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) sitting in Gudu. When the case came up yesterday for his arraignment before Justice Abubakar Talba, the prosecution counsel, Mr. Larry Peters applied to withdraw the charge on the grounds that the Commission wants to put it’s house in order. His application was not opposed to by counsel to the former minister, Chief Chris Uche (SAN). Consequently, the charge was accordingly struck out by Justice Talba. The former minister had also filed a motion for bail through his lawyer, Chief Chris Uche, SAN, before the said court. The former minister who was last week released on bail upon order of court after weeks in custody, was in court with many relations, well-wishers and sympathisers. He was arrested and detained since October 24, 2016, when he went to honour an invitation by the Commission.
