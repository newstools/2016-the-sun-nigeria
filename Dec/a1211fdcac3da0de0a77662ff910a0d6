From Judex Okoro, Calabar Basking in the euphoria of his Superme Court victory, Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River has promised to create 50,000 jobs to alleviate employment problem in the state.
Besides, he has promised to appoint additional 6,000 aides to put food on the tables of politicians and family.
Ayade, who disclosed this while thanking a huge crowd who turned up at the U. J. Esuene Stadium, Calabar for the thanksgiving service to welcome him back to the state barely 10 days after the apex court affirmed him governor, said the victory was the Lord’s doing even as he insisted he was innocent of what he was accused of.
“I Thank all the groups who turned up today to receive me back to the state and for having confidence in me. I recommit myself to God for taking away the shame which my enemies wanted to bring on me.
“Today, I have known the benefit of being a child of God. I enjoined the detractors to sheathe their sword. From January you will see a different Ayade as I will be wearing T-Shirts and Jeans to work. And by 2019, you will not recognise the state. From January 2017, I will create 50,000 jobs.
“Cross River is number one when it comes to salary payment. I intend to expand governance to put food on the table. For me, youth empowerment remains a priority. Again, I will make additional 6,000 appointments; I will elevate and bring total emancipation of the state. I commit myself to serve you in truth,” he stated.
Over 100 support groups from the 18 local governments areas of Cross River turned up to welcome the governor. The groups dressed in different colourful attires, carried different placards in solidarity.
