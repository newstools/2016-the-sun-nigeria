From JULIANA TAIWO-OBALONYE, Abuja The Federal Government has blamed the biting economic situation in the country for its inability to reward the Super Falcons that won the just concluded African Women Cup of Nations in Cameroon. The Falcons last weekend defeated hosts, Cameroon to lift the coveted trophy a record a eight times. The Florence Omagbemi tutored girls who are being owed bonuses running into millions of dollars have been left in the lush since returning home. The Minister of Information, Culture and Touris, Lai Mohammed, who spoke yesterday on the plight of the girls said the girls are victims of recession. In his words: “Over time, it has become tradition to reward victorious athletes, but in the case of Falcons, I think this is caused by the biting economic situation.” Mohammed was however quick to add that sports minister, Solomon Dalung has raised the issue at the Federal Executive Council (FEC) assuring that there would be bail out for the girls. “The Minister of Youth and Sports, Solomon Dalung raised the issue  at FEC and the issue is being looked into. It was reported under other matters today (yesterday) at the Council,” Mohammed stated.
