…As military launches multiple raids From Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa Panic has gripped communities in Cross Rivers, Bayelsa and Delta states, as the Joint Force, Operation Delta Safe (ODS) intensifies efforts to flush out militants from their various camps.
The Joint Force has also beefed up security along the East- West road in the bid to chase out criminal gangs that have been terrorizing the area. The new Commander of the ODS, Rear Admiral Apochi Suleiman, in a press briefing over the weekend said the security outfit would not abdicate its responsibilities to protect lives and property in the region.
Suleiman, who announced the arrest of 11 suspected militants and recovery of arms, added that he would not condone the killing of soldiers by suspected militants hiding in Niger Delta communities.
The Commander further dismissed the claims regarding the bombing of oil facilities as lies, saying that ODS was on top of the situation in the region and would do everything to guard oil installations in the oil rich communities. He said it had become imperative for the authority to beef up security along the East- West road due to the activities of the criminals. “I want to assure all Niger Deltans that the ODS is on top of the security situation in the Niger Delta region. We are deploying troops to the East- West immediately to check the activities of criminal elements along that road. I want to assure passengers and all users of that road that they have nothing to fear as troops have been deployed to patrol the road to ensure the safety of Nigerians living in the area and those plying the road during the yuletide season,” he said.
