From Wole Balogun, Ado-Ekiti Ado-Ekiti residents at the weekend decried the outrageous bill being charged by the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC).
Daily Sun gathered that some residents at Adebayo, along Nova Road 2, decried electricity bill allegedly put at N5,000 to N6,000 per month.
Reacting, a source from BEDC office that spoke to Daily Sun on condition of anonymity, said proactive steps were being taken to improve on the power supply to every nook and cranny of the state.
A resident, Mr. Kayode Ajayi, who resides at Nova Road 2, said the bill was high while the power supply was low, which he said most times affected his shoe-making business. Another resident, Mrs Funke Adegoke, of No 1, Dallimore, said her monthly bill was N8,000 while Mr. Ademola Olusola, said the bill charged per month was between N5,000 and N7,000, stating that the power supply was too low.
