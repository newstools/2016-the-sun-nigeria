The 24 various Nigerian language translations of the Bible will be on display at the one-week Bible marathon reading exercise which begins today in Lagos.
According to the Bible Society, the 2016 Bible Reading Campaign will be declared open at Shepherd’s Flock International Church, Lagos by the General Secretary of the organization, Mr. Dare Ajiboye.
It said the week-long programme will simultaneously take place in 50 different Centres across the country.
“The unique feature of this programme is that it gives the participants opportunity to read the Bible aloud in their own native languages.
“Participants, irrespective of denomination, age or sex, will have a three-fold joy by participating.
“They will have the joy of reading the Bible in their languages, helping someone else hear the Word of God in a new way and joining others in continuous reading of the Bible.”
The statement further said that BSN is a not-for-profit-making interdenominational Christian organization that translates the Bible into Nigerian Languages, publishes and distributes it and also raises funds for Bible work.
