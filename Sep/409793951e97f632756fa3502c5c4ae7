From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure Ondo State Governor, Olusegun Mimiko has called for prayers for the state as preparations heightened towards the November 26 governorship election.
The governor noted that only prayers can sustain the prevailing peace being enjoyed by the people since the beginning of his administration. Mimiko implored the people to help the state with prayer so that peace which had been a permanent feature of the state was not breached.
Addressing the congregation at the 70th anniversary service and dedication of the main auditorium of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Oke Igan in Akure, yesterday, Mimiko said elections conducted under his administration were peaceful, including the ones conducted by the trade union groups.
He lauded President of CAC Worldwide, Pastor Abraham Akinosun and called for prayers for the peace of Nigeria and the success of his administration. He admonished the church not to relent in its prayers for Ondo State, especially as it was about to witness another governorship election, stressing that only prayers could sustain the prevailing peace being enjoyed by the people since the beginning of his administration.
Mimiko, who commended the leaders and members of the CAC for their prayers, enjoined Nigerians not to be discouraged by the current economic situation in the country, but to remain prayerful.
“I am bold to say it anywhere that your prayers as saints have upheld us in this state. We have continued to enjoy peace, which does not come ordinarily but through your prayers. It is clear that all the elections that have been conducted since we came on board have been peaceful. Even the NURTW election that used to be chaotic was conducted inside our Dome here very peacefully.”
