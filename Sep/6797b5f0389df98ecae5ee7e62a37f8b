The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) said yesterday that it has intelligence reports that many foreigners in Edo State are in possession of permanent voter cards (PVCs).
David Adi, comptroller of the service in Edo, said this while addressing leaders of the Nigerien, Malian and Chadian communities in the state.
Adi warned foreigners in the state to stay off Wednesday’s governorship election.
“Intelligence reports available have it that many foreigners in the state are in possession of the Nigerian permanent voters card (PVC) with a view to using them for the election.
“No foreigner is allowed to participate in the election because it is for only Nigerians. The Nigerian Immigration Service will not tolerate any attempt by any group of foreigners to truncate this election.
“Any foreigner caught with a PVC will not only be prosecuted but will also be repatriated. We want this election to go down in history as the most transparent, credible and freely-conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
“We have resolved to assist INEC to succeed; there is a synergy among security agencies to ensure that the Edo governorship election is free, fair, credible and conclusive.
“Every polling unit in the 18 local government areas will have an immigration officer and they have been deployed to man polling units and are well trained to fish out any foreigner.”
Responding, Halidu Ibrahim, president of the Niger citizens resident in Edo, prayed for the success of the election.
He promised to talk to his people to stay away from voting centres and polling units.
