Former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has said Nigeria needs economic re-strategising and re-planning to achieve sustainable national prosperity.
Addressing reporters after observing Eid prayers at Dodan Barracks praying ground in Lagos, yesterday, Tinubu said lack of solid foundation contributed to the nation’s current economic situation.
“We need to re-strategise and re-plan, but, that planning period is always a very difficult period in any family, organisation and nation.
“That is what we are experiencing now, but, it is for a better and stronger future.
“The political and economic stability we are enjoying in Lagos, today, is as a result of solid foundation.
“Without good and solid foundation, we cannot achieve a sustainable economic prosperity,” he said.
