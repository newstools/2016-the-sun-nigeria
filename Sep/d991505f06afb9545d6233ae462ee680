Governor Rauf Aregbesola of Osun State, yesterday, said his administration has not received Ecological Fund from the Federal Government in the last five years.
This was contained in a statement by his media aide, Mr Semiu Okanlawon, Media aide.
Aregbesola said the demand by the state chapter of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that government should justify how it spent ecological funds in the wake of the flood that affected some parts of the state was uncalled for.
“Osun did not receive any ecological fund from the PDP Federal Government from November 27, 2010 to May 29, 2015.
“We have expended our legitimate revenues from all sources to annually dredge our waterways up till 2015 when revenue decline hindered our efforts.
“Despite the dirty politics played by the PDP government at the centre, Osun remained one of the few states that had never experienced any flooding since 2011, not untill the unfortunate incident of Tuesday, September 13.
“We are concerned with the agony of our citizens and shall do all in our power to limit the pains and prevent a reoccurrence.
“We are committed to eliminating all hindrances to free flow of water in the canals, drainages and waterways in the state”.
Aregbesola, while calling on the people of the state to desist from indiscriminate dumping of refuse, urged them to always patronise registered waste collectors.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that flood wrecked havoc in some part of the state on Tuesday, September 13, during which property worth millions of naira were destroyed. Click Here>>>>>>Anti-kidnap and anti-theft device for tracking and listening<<<<<<
