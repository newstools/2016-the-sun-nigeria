From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the death of former Deputy Governor of Kano State, Senator Magaji Abdullahi, describing him as one of Nigeria’s finest and result-driven engineers of his time.
The Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, in a statement said Buhari who sent a federal delegation to the family and state government led by Sulaiman Adamu, the Minister of Water Resources,  noted that under Magaji’s tenure as head of one of the foremost water development agencies, Water Resources and Engineering Construction Agency (WRECA), Kano State enjoyed the best water supply and availability, describing it as a remarkable feat.
President Buhari said the late Magaji was preoccupied with producing practical results rather than theorising about his job, a quality he noted, made him an outstanding engineer who deserves a special place in the engineering profession.
According to the President,  achieving results was the best advertisement for any man in office, adding that the late Magaji’s notable contributions to the development and progress of Kano State would not be forgotten.
The President prayed  Allah to grant the deceased an eternal rest in peace and a worthy place in Paradise.
The Federal Government delegation included the Minister (State) Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika, the Senior Special Assistant (Media and Publicity) Garba Shehu and the Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris.
The delegation was received by the family of the deceased, the Galadima of Kano, Dr Abbas Sunusi on behalf of the Emir and the Governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje.
