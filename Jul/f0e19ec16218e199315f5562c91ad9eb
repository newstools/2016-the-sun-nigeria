Business experts will on Wednesday converge on the Abia State capital, Aba, to address the challenges faced by local manufacturers, producers, traders and other players in the informal sector of the Nigerian economy.
The conference is being organized by the MINEC Platform, a consortium of different technical partners with relevant skills in the development, establishment and management of Small and Medium Enterprises. A similar conference will be held in the remaining five geopolitical zones of the country.
According to a statement issued by the Lead Partner of MINEC and CEO, EfficientLinks Ltd, Lawrence Ehilegbu, prominent participants in the conference include the  Abia State Government, Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON), Nigeria Export Promotion Council and Gionee Telecommunication.
According to a statement said, the conference aims “to close the knowledge gap between the points of production to a successful market launch of products as well as routes-to-markets globally.”  At the end of the conference, participants are expected to “go beyond their limits” as they will be able to “develop a functional ‘verify’ platform that increases international buyers’ confidence while doing business with local SMEs.”
MINEC supports entrepreneurial development, capacity and skill building and opens windows that showcase made-in-Nigeria goods and services to the international markets for wide acceptance and patronage, the statement said.
