From Godwin Tsa, Abuja The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja yesterday dismissed the no case submission filed by former Governor of Imo State, Ikedi Ohakim over alleged corruption and money laundering offences.
Justice Adeniyi Ademola, who threw out the application, held that the prosecution led by Festus Keyamo has established a prima facie case against Ohakim.
The court adjourned till October 10 and 13 for the former governor to open his defence.
Ohakim was arraigned on July 8 last year by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on a three-count charge of money laundering, arising from his alleged purchase of a house in Abuja with cash payment in dollar equivalent of N270million in November 2008.
He was alleged to have committed the crime while in office.
Ohakim, according to an EFCC witness, had paid the sum in hard currency of $2.29 million to acquire a piece of land at Plot No. 1098 Cadastral Zone A04, Asokoro District, otherwise known as No.60, Kwame Nkurumah Street, Asokoro, Abuja.
He was admitted to bail by Justice Ademola on July 9, 2015 after his arraignment.
The prosecution, in establishing its case against the defendant, called six witnesses before the no case submission was filed by the defendant.
