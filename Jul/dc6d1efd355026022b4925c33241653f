From Fred Itua, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has forwarded the 2016 budget proposals of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and 36 other Agencies to the National Assembly for consideration.
President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, who presided at plenary, announced that President Buhari had asked that the budget for the 38 agnecies be given accelerated approval to allow them expend funds for various projects in line with their statutory laws and mandate.
The announcement of the budget proposals for the 38 agencies coincided with Senate scheduled open debate on the alleged consistent refusal of the CBN to comply with the constitutional provision which stipulates that it must submit annual reports on its financial dealings to the National Assembly.
