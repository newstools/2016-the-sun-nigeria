By MONICA IHEAKAM As the search for a permanent coach for the Super Eagles hits its climax, Daily Sunsports can today reveal that only the applications of 10 coaches are now to be considered.
A competent Glass House source disclosed last night that the applications sent in has been pruned down to 10.
It was gathered that former Cameroonian coach, Paul Le Guen,  caretaker coach, Salisu Yusuf and the Serbian duo of Goran Stevanovic and Ivo Sajh are among those still in the hot race for  the plum post.
Daily SunSport was reliably informed that due to the two-day public holiday declared by the Federal Government for Tuesday and Wednesday respectively, the application portal closed by Monday midnight.
Meanwhile, Chairman of the soccer federation’s technical committee Chris Green revealed that questionnaire would be sent to the coaches.
He said the coaches would be rated based on their performance in the written test and three of them shortlisted for interview.
He confirmed that everything is on course and the process of getting the best man to handle the Super Eagles has reached advanced stage  with the NFF Secretariat poised to  handle the process in a transparent manner.
Green  reaffirmed  the technical committee’s  commitment to hiring the best man for the national team, assuring that come July 14, 2016 a new Super Eagles coach would be unveiled.
