From Fred Itua, Abuja Senate President, Senator Bukola Saraki, yesterday, dispelled rumours that he was plotting his way out of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
The embattled Senate President said his loyalty to the governing APC was not in doubt.
Saraki also reiterated his belief that the President Muhammadu Buhari’s government would redeem the electoral promises it made to the electorate during the 2015 general elections.
Senators Saraki spoke at the 10th Abuja Housing Show where top government officials and prominent stakeholders in the housing sector brainstormed on the theme: “Expanding Access To Affordable Housing In Africa.”
Acknowledging the presence of the APC National Organising Secretary, Senator Osita Izunaso, who kick-started discussions at the summit, Saraki assured that the APC government was unwaveringly committed to the social welfare of the people while re-affirming his unalloyed loyalty to the party.
The Senate President, while reacting to observations that the existing housing laws needed respective amendment and repeal, charged the organisers of the summit to take a further step by forwarding a document of laws requiring amendments to the National Assembly.
“I assure you that action will be taken instantaneously,” Saraki promised.
Saraki asserted that the Senate had commenced the review processes of several laws affecting property rights and access to housing in the country.
According to Senator Izunaso, housing deficit in Nigeria was pegged at 17 million housing units.
“As at today, only 10 per cent of those who dream to own a house in the country can afford it, as against the 92 per cent house owners in Singapore. The central objective of the summit, however, is to come up with feasible strategies on how to end the problem of homelessness in Nigeria,” Ozunaso said.
