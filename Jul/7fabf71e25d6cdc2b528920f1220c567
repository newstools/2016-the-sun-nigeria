Several people are feared killed in a shooting at a shopping centre in the German city of Munich, police say. A big security operation is under way at the Olympia shopping centre in the north-western Moosach district. Police say they do not know where the attacker or attackers are and are telling people in Munich to stay at home and avoid the streets. Shop workers have been unable to leave the building. There is no information about a possible motive for the attack. There are unconfirmed reports of at least one other shooting incident elsewhere in the city. The security forces have been on alert after a teenage migrant stabbed and injured five people on a train in Bavaria on Monday in an attack claimed by so-called Islamic State. The authorities had warned of the danger of further attacks.
