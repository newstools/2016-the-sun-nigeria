From Molly Kilete and Fred Itua Abuja Senator Oluremi Tinubu, yesterday, requested increased police protection from the Acting Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, saying her life is in danger.
In a petition to the acting IGP, Mrs Tinubu asked the police authorities to grant her protection “to avoid being killed.”
The senator who said that she would have ignored her encounter with Senator Dino Melaye, alleged that since the senator had “between 2007 and 2011, while in the House of Representatives, engaged in fisticuffs with his colleagues that led to his untimely death,” she does not feel safe.
Her petition read: “I am Senator Oluremi Tinubu, representing the Lagos Central Senatorial District of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
“During proceedings of the Senate on Tuesday, July 14, 2016, I had cause to contribute to a matter of national importance. Apparently dissatisfied with my contributions, Senator Dino Melaye threw caution to the wind and resorted to vulgar abuse of my person and wanted to assault me.
“The timely intervention of a number of colleagues prevented Senator Melaye from unleashing physical attack on me. However, as the leadership of the Senate did not call him to order in the circumstance, he proceeded to threaten my life without any provocation whatsoever.
“In view of Senator Melaye’s antecedent, particularly, in the House of Representatives, I have decided not to ignore his threat..fj. Therefore, I’m compelled to urge you to use your good offices to provide me with adequate security.
“Please accept the assurances of my highest regards and esteem.”
