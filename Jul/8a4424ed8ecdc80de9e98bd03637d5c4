BY TONY OGAGA ERHARIEFE DESPITE the harsh economic times, singer, motivational speaker and entrepreneur, Queen Ure, courtesy of her Popori platform in con­junction with Dream & Become Int’l paid a visit to Precious Pearl Orphanage, located in Egbeda, Lagos, where she donated food items and spent times with the inmates. “Giving out to people who need love, care and help makes me feel really fulfilled. I started my first charity outing single-handedly in 2013 and ever since I have never relented because of the joy and fulfillment I get from it,” Ure told Entertainer. Commenting on why she embarks on the outing every quarter, Ure continued: “The answer lies in the passion I have for giving. I have always loved giving and that is why I can’t stop. After a while, I stopped making it a personal thing by involving other people. And we have been doing it under the Porpori Op­portunity platform. “We have been to so many homes and our coming to Precious Pearls Orphanage is our seventh outing. It honestly makes me happy and fulfilled carrying these tender lovely kids, sharing love and gift items. What could be more fulfilling than this? Nothing really,” Ure said. Could this be her way of giving back to the society? “Well, if you describe it as that, let it be. I pray that more women would come and join the platform. Let us give back to society.
