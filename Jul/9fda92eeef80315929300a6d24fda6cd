Boss of Lexa Records and fast rising international Footballer, Jeffery Owen, has urge the Nigerian Government to invest more in sports. The Germany-based-Nigerian-footballer in a telephone interview from his base in Germany, also enjoined Nigerians to cultivate the habit of visiting stadiums and other sporting centers within the country. “I think a lot of youth football platforms like academies should be opened so young ones interested in the sport can start very young, training and grooming for the future. This would help develop the sport in the country and also, more youths should get involved because this would lead to positive change and growth.” On how he became a professional footballer he continued: “Playing in Germany is actually very competitive; there are tons of good footballers here. In Germany, they focus on technique and control but in Nigeria we focus on power and it is a very different style of play here in Germany. Back in Nigeria, my career as a professional footballer never kicked-off until I moved to South Africa for my tertiary studies. “While schooling I was privileged to join a team and I started my journey on becoming a professional soccer player. I have always wanted to be a footballer. I remember growing up as a child and always wanting to play football but I never saw myself venturing into professional football while in Nigeria. I was just playing street football and today the rest is history,” He quipped. Speaking on his record label he continued: “Aside playing football I am also a label CEO. I have invested millions of naira into the fast-growing Nigeria music industry, having realised the potentials the industry holds. Lexa Records, my label boasts the likes of singer, Mawthie among others,” he concuded.
