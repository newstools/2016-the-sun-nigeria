Ibrahim Idris, Acting Inspector-General of Police (IG), has ordered the arrest of the killers of Lazarus Agaie, the traditional ruler of Bokkos in Plateau state. According to Don Awunah, spokesman of the police, he said the Acting IG directed Joshack Habilla, Deputy-Inspector-General of Police (DIG) operations to proceed to Plateau to lead the task. Awunah disclosed this in a statement issued in Abuja on Thursday. The statement said Idris ordered that those behind the gruesome murder of the monarch should be fished out in record time. It quoted Idris as saying “it is pathetic to see the life of any Nigerian, irrespective of his or her status, snuffed out by any criminal gang in whatever name.” The IG also said the death of the monarch, his family and orderly, were particularly painful, but more painful when people took to reprisal attacks. He therefore advised the aggrieved to be patient with the Police in their investigation into the murder of the monarch but needed the collaboration of everyone with useful information. Agaie was murdered alongside his wife, son and police orderly.
