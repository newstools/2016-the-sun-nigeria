FROM ROMANUS UGWU, ABUJA FORMER Super Eagles striker and mem­ber Technical Sub-committee of the Ni­geria Football Federation (NFF), Mutiu Adepoju, has expressed confidence that the Super Eagles will make it to the Russia 2018 World Cup. Adepoju, who spoke exclusively to Daily Sunsports said the present Eagles is populated by talented young players that can take any opponent to the cleaners when the Russia 2018 qualifiers get under­way in October. Headmaster, as friends and acquain­tances fondly call him said: “We have the talents that can get us the ticket but it is only left for them to come out fighting and play the matches with determination and patriotic zeal.” Continuing Adepoju said: “Yes, we all know that we are in a very difficult group but nothing is impossible. I also believe that if they work very hard, we are going to get the quali­fication ticket. “Don’t forget that other countries in our group should also be wary and afraid of Nigeria. So, we should not be afraid of any team and this is the time we must show that we are still a force to be reckoned with in the round leather game.”
