THE Buhari South- East Youth Movement (BUSEYM) has aligned with the Attorney Gen­eral of the Federation and Minister of Justice, who said that Senate President Bukola Saraki and Dep­uty Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, are on trial and not the National As­sembly. Specifically speaking on Ekweremadu, the group accused the Deputy Sen­ate president of “vaulting ambition.” It advised Ekweremadu to “go defend the allega­tions” levelled against him “in a court of compe­tent jurisdiction and leave Ndigbo and President Muhammadu Buhari out of it.” The group said gone were the days when people used the collective des­tiny of Igbo to advance personal ambitions by playing the ethnic card. “Ekweremadu should not say he is being perse­cuted because of his eth­nicity,” stated the group, in a statement signed by its Director-General, Nwabueze Onwuneme and National Publicity Secretary Igwe Samuel Obinna. “We are alarmed that­Senator Ekweremadu, in reaction to the case against him at the Federal High Court is resorting to blame game. “He must accept his fate because it is the ‘lead­ership of the Senate that is on trial for forgery and not the Senate nor Igbo ethnic nationality.” The group frowned at Ekweremadu’s letters to various international or­ganisations and countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States. “If such trials ema­nate in those countries he wrote concerning his ‘purported persecution’ by the Nigerian govern­ment the most appropri­ate thing they do in those countries is for the indi­vidual on trial to either resign or step aside pend­ing judgement from the courts,” it stated. The group accused the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of trying to take what it is not entitled to. According to it, for 16 years the PDP was in power, it always produced both the Senate Presi­dent and the deputy, but now the party wants to share power at the Senate with the APC.
