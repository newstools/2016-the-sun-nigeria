From Agaju Madugba, Katsina A Katsina State Magistrate Court heard yesterday that a family from Saika village of Batsari Local Government Area fed their dog with a live day-old baby boy. A traditional ruler from the village reported the in­cident to the police, accord­ing to the First Information Report by the investigating police officer, Inspector Al­tine Ragaji. According to him, mother of the baby, Wasila Halilu, 15, got pregnant after she was allegedly raped in a farm by 45-year-old Musa Garba. The court ordered that Garba, along with members of the family, Muhammad Bello (45), Musa Bello (35), Umar Bello (27) and the girl’s mother, Faiza (30), be held in prison custody. They were charged with  “an act done with intent to prevent a child from being alive after birth,” contrary to sections, 235, 387 and 85 of the penal code. The police said the ac­cused persons admitted they conspired to get rid of the baby by feeding the dog with it, as the family consid­ered pregnancy and conse­quent delivery of the baby as shameful since she was not married. Ragaji quoted the girl as saying that Garba lured her to his farm and forcefully had sexual intercourse with her about 10 months ago af­ter which she became preg­nant. The Chief Magistrate, Nura El-Ladan, explained that the case was brought to court for cognisance and di­rected the police to carry out further investigations into the matter while adjourn­ing till August 8, for further hearing.
