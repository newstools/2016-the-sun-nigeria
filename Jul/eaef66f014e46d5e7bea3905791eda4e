■ Lawmakers reject grazing reserves FROM KEMI YESUFU, ABUJA FEDERAL lawmakers from Southern Kaduna zone have protested the decision of Governor Ahmed el- Rufai to establish grazing reserves for the Fulani herdsmen in Southern Kaduna Senatorial zone. This is just as the lawmakers raised the alarm that communities under Sanga and Jema’a Local Govern­ment areas in the zone were razed about two weeks ago, while about 100 people were said to have been killed in the attacks. Speaking at a press conference jointly addressed by a member of the Senate, Danjuma La’ah and a member of the House of Representatives, Shehu Gar­ba Sarkin Noma, the lawmakers also kicked against the Kaduna State government’s decision to locate 17 grazing reserves across the state, adding that the goal of turning them into commercial pasture hubs was un­realistic. Also at the briefing were other members of the House from the state, Simon Arabo and Sunday Mar­shal Katung. The lawmakers equally noted that the establish­ment of grazing reserves in their part of the state could worsen an already high level of suspicion between in­digenous farmers and the herdsmen. Noma said: “We the representatives of the people disapprove of any attempt to create or carve out lands in our communities for grazing reserves under the present circumstances. “As the Representatives of our people who are soaked in the heated disapproval of our constituents on this issue, we categorically say NO to grazing re­serves in Southern Kaduna.
