FC Ifeanyi Ubah’s Adah Stephen is expecting a tough test in today’s Nigeria Profes­sional Football League clash with El-Kanemi Warriors. Ubah are 11th in the Ni­geria Professional Football League table with 33 points from 24 matches. The Anambra Warriors are the favourites to win the match day 27 tie in Nnewi, but Adah believes the Desert Warriors could be dangerous customers. “El-Kanemi Warriors struggled at the beginning of the season but have picked up the pieces in their recent games,” Adah told Goal. “They have quality play­ers like Ibrahim Mustapha, Chinedu Ohanachom and Umar Zango. “I expect them to give us a good fight. Being a side that loves to attack they would give everything to cause an upset. “We won’t underrate them and have prepared the best way possible for this match. They will be tough, but we should beat them and improve our position in the league table.
